[Tenders for] [the bonds] [available in] [minimum denominations] [of $] [1,000 must] [be received] [by 1] [p.m. EDT] [Wednesday at] [Federal Reserve] [banks]
[Refcorp created] [by the] [thrift-overhaul law] [enacted in] [August will] [use the] [proceeds to] [merge sell] [off ailing] [savings-and-loan institutions]
[Congress authorized] [$ 50] [billion to] [be borrowed] [to pay] [for the] [thrift bailout]
[Of that] [amount $] [20 billion] [has already] [been borrowed] [by the] [Treasury Department]
[Unless otherwise] [specified in] [a particular] [offer the] [bonds wo] [n't be] [subject to] [redemption prior] [to maturity]
[Interest payments] [on the] [bonds will] [be payable] [semiannually]
[The bonds] [are subject] [to federal] [taxation in] [the U.S.] [including income] [taxes]

[G.D. Searle] [& Co.] [a Monsanto] [Co. unit] [is launching] [a program] [to give] [consumers more] [information about] [its drugs] [when doctors] [prescribe them]
[Called Patients] [in the] [Know the] [program features] [fact sheets] [designed to] [be easy] [to understand]
[The sheets] [tell how] [the medicine] [works describe] [how to] [use it] [list its] [possible side] [effects]
[They are] [designed to] [be given] [to patients] [by their] [doctors when] [the medicines] [are prescribed] [include space] [for the] [doctor to] [write special] [instructions]
[In addition] [Searle will] [give pharmacists] [brochures on] [the use] [of prescription] [drugs for] [distribution in] [their stores]
[Consumer groups] [have long] [advocated that] [drug companies] [doctors make] [more information] [available to] [patients]
[We believe] [that every] [drug that] ['s marketed] [to a] [consumer should] [have a] [consumer label] [said Douglas] [Teich of] [the Public] [Citizen Health] [Research Group] [a Ralph] [Nader affiliate]
[Dr. Teich] [said Searle] [is the] [only company] [I know] [that voluntarily] ['' will] [make consumer] [information available]
[According to] [federal officials] [drug-industry studies] [nearly half] [of the] [1.6 billion] [prescriptions filled] [each year] [are n't] [used properly] [meaning money] [is wasted] [on some] [prescriptions patients] [are deprived] [of the] [benefits of] [medication]
[We think] [it 's] [very important] [to provide] [as much] [information as] [possible on] [the drugs] [consumers take] [said Searle] [Chairman Sheldon] [Gilgore]
[Bond prices] [rambled yesterday] [as investors] [kept close] [watch on] [the stock] [market worried] [about a] [wave of] [new supply]
[Early yesterday] [bonds rose] [as investors] [rushed to] [buy Treasury] [securities on] [the prospect] [that stocks] [would plummet] [in the] [aftermath of] [the massive] [California earthquake]
[For example] [some securities] [analysts warned] [that stocks] [of certain] [insurance companies] [which face] [massive damage] [claims would] [get hit] [hard]
[when the] [Dow Jones] [Industrial Average] [rose instead] [bonds drifted] [lower]
[With stocks] [not a] [major focus] [we 're] [waiting for] [the next] [guiding light] [said Brian] [J. Fabbri] [chief economist] [at Midland] [Montagu Securities] [Inc]
[If the] [stock market] [tremors are] [behind us] [then the] [bond market] [will go] [back to] [looking at] [the next] [batch of] [economic numbers] [to determine] [where interest] [rates are] [heading]
[The Treasury] ['s benchmark] [30-year bond] [which jumped] [3\/8 point] [about $] [3.75 for] [each $] [1,000 face] [amount during] [the first] [hour of] [trading ended] [little changed]
[Interest rates] [barely budged] [from Tuesday] ['s levels]
[Most junk] [bonds which] [have been] [battered in] [recent weeks] [continued a] [slow recuperation] [ended unchanged] [slightly higher]
[some so-called] [high-quality junk] [issues fell] [as some] [mutual funds] [sold their] [most liquid] [issues to] [raise cash]
[RJR Holdings] [Capital Corp.] ['s 14.7] [% bonds] [due 2009] [fell one] [point]
[Other RJR] [issues fell] [between 1\/2] [point 1] [1\/2 point]
[In the] [latest sign] [of how] [difficult it] [is to] [place certain] [junk bonds] [Continental Airlines] [said it] [was forced] [to scale] [back the] [size of] [its latest] [offering]
[Continental a] [unit of] [Texas Air] [Corp. slashed] [the size] [of its] [note offering] [from $] [150 million] [to $] [71 million]
[The move] [had been] [widely expected]
[In the] [multipart offering] [the company] [sold a] [portion of] [secured notes] [shelved all] [the unsecured] [notes]
[A Continental] [spokeswoman said] [the notes] [may be] [offered at] [a later] [date]
[This was] [a do-or-die] [deal she] [said]
[I think] [this is] [a market] [that required] [some level] [of security]
[It did] [not make] [sense to] [offer unsecured] [paper in] [an unsettling] [market]
[Investors have] [been speculating] [for weeks] [about the] [market 's] [ability to] [place the] [$ 7] [billion to] [$ 10] [billion of] [new junk] [bonds scheduled] [to be] [sold by] [year end]
[Supply troubles] [were also] [on the] [minds of] [Treasury investors] [yesterday who] [worried about] [the flood] [of new] [government securities] [coming next] [week]
[We 're] [being bombarded] [by new] [Treasury and] [agency debt] [offerings said] [William Sullivan] [Jr. director] [of money-market] [research at] [Dean Witter] [Reynolds Inc]
[The market] [is concerned] [about its] [ability to] [underwrite all] [this debt] [at current] [levels]
[In addition] [to the] [$ 15.6] [billion of] [Treasury bills] [to be] [sold at] [next week] ['s regular] [Monday auction] [the government] [will sell] [$ 10] [billion of] [new two-year] [Treasury notes]
[Resolution Funding] [Corp. said] [late yesterday] [that it] [will sell] [$ 4.5] [billion of] [30-year bonds] [Wednesday]
[Refcorp is] [the financing] [unit of] [Resolution Trust] [Corp. a] [new government] [agency created] [to rescue] [the nation] ['s troubled] [thrifts]
[Its securities] [have been] [dubbed bailout] [bonds by] [traders]
[In when-issued] [trading the] [two-year Treasurys] [had a] [yield of] [about 7.88] [%]
[In the] [municipal market] [all eyes] [were on] [California debt] [as investors] [tried to] [gauge the] [financial ramifications] [of Tuesday] ['s earthquake]
[traders said] [the quake] [had only] [a minor] [impact on] [the trading] [of California] [state and] [local municipal] [debt]
[There are] [certain bonds] [traders refer] [to as] [` earthquake] [' bonds] [because the] [-LRB- issuers] [are on] [top of] [the San] [Andreas fault] [said Zane] [Mann editor] [of the] [California Municipal] [Bond Advisor] [a newsletter] [for investors]
[Since those] [bonds already] [pay a] [slightly higher] [yield an] [extra premium] [for the] [earthquake risk] [they were] [n't materially] [affected]
[some bond] [market analysts] [said that] [could quickly] [change if] [property casualty] [insurance companies] [scramble to] [sell portions] [of their] [municipal portfolios] [to raise] [cash to] [pay damage] [claims]
[Insurance companies] [will foot] [a substantial] [amount of] [the bill] [to reconstruct] [San Francisco] [said Charles] [Lieberman chief] [economist at] [Manufacturers Hanover] [Securities Corp]
[He also] [expects the] [performance of] [municipals to] [lag Treasurys] [as California] [is forced] [to issue] [new debt] [over time] [to repair] [public facilities]
[A report] [issued late] [yesterday by] [Standard &] [Poor 's] [Corp. concluded] [the quake] [wo n't] [cause wide-scale] [credit deterioration] [for issuers] [debt issues] [in the] [12-county area] [of Northern] [California affected] [by the] [quake]
[Treasury Securities]
[Treasury bonds] [ended narrowly] [mixed in] [quiet trading]
[The benchmark] [30-year bond] [ended at] [a price] [of 100] [29\/32 to] [yield 8.03] [% compared] [with 100] [28\/32 to] [yield 8.04] [% Tuesday]
[The latest] [10-year notes] [were quoted] [late at] [a price] [of 99] [26\/32 to] [yield 8] [% compared] [with 99] [25\/32 to] [yield 8.01] [%]
[Short-term rates] [were little] [changed]
[Corporate Issues]
[Investment-grade corporate] [bonds ended] [1\/4 point] [lower]
[The Continental] [junk bond] [offering underwritten] [by Drexel] [Burnham Lambert] [Inc. was] [the only] [new issue] [priced yesterday]
[In the] [four-part offering] [the $] [71 million] [of secured] [equipment certificates] [was priced] [to yield] [13.75 %] [15.75 %]
[Municipal bonds] [ended about] [1\/8 to] [3\/8 point] [lower hurt] [by the] [circulation of] [two ``] [bid-wanted ''] [lists totaling] [$ 655] [million]
[Chemical Securities] [Inc. is] [acting as] [agent for] [the seller]
[Meanwhile some] [California issues] [were down] [a touch] [more than] [the broad] [market traders] [said there] [had n't] [been much] [investor selling] [because of] [the quake]
[New York] [City general] [obligation bonds] [came under] [selling pressure]
[Traders said] [a steady] [stream of] [bonds was] [put up] [for sale] [yesterday pushing] [yields for] [longer maturities] [up 0.05] [percentage point]
[Traders said] [investors were] [reacting to] [recent negative] [news on] [the city] ['s finances] [are nervous] [ahead of] [the Nov.] [7 election]
[Washington D.C.] [topped the] [competitive slate] [yesterday with] [a sale] [of $] [200 million] [of general] [obligation tax] [revenue anticipation] [notes]
[In late] [trading New] [Jersey Turnpike] [Authority 's] [7.20 %] [issue of] [2018 was] [off 1\/4] [point at] [98 bid]
[The yield] [was 7.35] [% up] [0.01 percentage] [point]
[Mortgage-Backed Securities]
[Mortgage securities] [ended little] [changed after] [light dealings]
[There was] [no appreciable] [market impact] [from the] [California earthquake]
[Dealers said] [there was] [some concern] [that insurance] [companies might] [be forced] [to sell] [mortgage securities] [to help] [pay earthquake-related] [claims no] [selling materialized]
[The Federal] [Home Loan] [Mortgage Corp.] [and Federal] [National Mortgage] [Association two] [dominant issuers] [of mortgage] [securities have] [a sizable] [amount of] [California home] [loans in] [their mortgagebacked] [pools]
[their potential] [quake exposure] [is seen] [as small] [given that] [they require] [a financial] [cushion on] [all the] [loans they] [purchase]
[because Northern] [California home] [prices are] [so high] [loans from] [the region] [often are] [too large] [to be] [included in] [Freddie Mac] [and Fannie] [Mae pools]
[Meanwhile Government] [National Mortgage] [Association 9] [% securities] [for November] [delivery ended] [at 97] [29\/32 unchanged]
[Freddie Mac] [9 %] [securities were] [at 97] [4\/32 down] [1\/32]
[In derivative] [markets Fannie] [Mae issued] [two $] [400 million] [real estate] [mortgage investment] [conduits backed] [by its] [9 %] [securities]
[Foreign Bonds]
[British government] [bonds gilts] [ended moderately] [lower as] [equities there] [recovered from] [Tuesday 's] [drop]
[The Treasury] ['s 11] [3\/4 %] [bond due] [2003\/2007 fell] [11\/32 to] [111 31\/32] [to yield] [10.08 %] [while the] [12 %] [notes due] [1995 were] [down 7\/32] [to 103] [22\/32 to] [yield 11.04] [%]
[Traders said] [today may] [be an] [anxious day] [for the] [market]
[Several key] [economic figures] [are due] [out of] [the Exchequer] [Nigel Lawson] [is scheduled] [to give] [the annual] [`` Mansion] [House ''] [address to] [the financial] [community]
[The chancellor] [sometimes has] [used the] [occasion to] [announce major] [economic policy] [changes]
[Economists do] [n't expect] [any such] [changes in] [this year] ['s address] [given Mr.] [Lawson 's] [apparent reluctance] [to adjust] [policy currently]
[Meanwhile Japanese] [government bonds] [retreated in] [quiet trading] [stymied by] [the dollar] ['s resiliency]
[Japan 's] [4.6 %] [bond due] [1998 ended] [on brokers] [' screens] [at 95.75] [to yield] [5.315 %]
[In West] [Germany investors] [stayed on] [the sidelines] [as the] [bond market] [searched for] [direction]
[The government] ['s 7] [% issue] [due October] [1999 fell] [0.05 point] [to 99.90] [to yield] [7.01 %]
[The Berlin] [Wall still] [stands]
[the man] [who built] [it has] [fallen]
[East Germany] [yesterday removed] [Erich Honecker] [one of] [the staunchest] [holdouts against] [the reform] [rumbling through] [the Communist] [world in] [an effort] [to win] [back the] [confidence of] [its increasingly] [rebellious citizens]
[while it] [was a] [move that] [stunned the] [East bloc] [it hardly] [ushers in] [an era] [of reform] [at least] [anytime soon]
[the Politburo] [replaced Mr.] [Honecker who] [had led] [East Germany] [for 18] [years before] [that headed] [its security] [apparatus with] [a man] [cut of] [the same] [cloth Egon] [Krenz the] [most recent] [internal-security chief] [a longtime] [Honecker protege]
[East Germany] [it is] [clear is] [no Poland] [where the] [Communist Party] [now shares] [power with] [the democratically] [elected Solidarity] [union]
[it a] [Hungary where] [yesterday the] [parliament approved] [constitutional changes] [meant to] [help turn] [the Communist] [nation into] [a multiparty] [democracy]
[Still any] [change in] [East Germany] [has enormous] [implications for] [both East] [and West]
[It raises] [the long-cherished] [hopes of] [many Germans] [for reunification] [a prospect] [that almost] [equally alarms] [political leaders] [in Moscow] [Washington Western] [Europe]
[Mr. Krenz] [52 was] [named the] [new party] [chief just] [minutes after] [the Party] ['s 163-member] [Central Committee] [convened in] [East Berlin]
[Although the] [East German] [news agency] [ADN claimed] [Mr. Honecker] [had asked] [to be] [relieved of] [his duties] [for health] [reasons West] [German government] [sources said] [the 26-man] [Politburo had] [asked for] [his resignation] [at a] [separate meeting] [late Tuesday]
[Mr. Honecker] [was twice] [hospitalized this] [summer for] [a gall] [bladder ailment] [his physical] [condition has] [been the] [subject of] [intense speculation] [in the] [Western media]
[ADN said] [Mr. Honecker] [a hard-line] [Stalinist who] [in 1961] [supervised the] [construction of] [the Berlin] [Wall also] [was relieved] [of his] [title as] [head of] [state his] [position as] [chief of] [the military]
[Mr. Krenz] [is expected] [to be] [formally named] [to all] [three positions] [once the] [nation 's] [parliament convenes] [later this] [week]
[Mr. Honecker] ['s ignoble] [fall culminates] [nearly two] [decades of] [iron-handed leadership] [during which] [Mr. Honecker] [77 years] [old built] [East Germany] [into the] [most economically] [advanced nation] [in the] [Soviet bloc]
[His grip] [on power] [unraveled this] [summer as] [thousands of] [his countrymen] [dissatisfied by] [the harshness] [of his] [rule fled] [to the] [West]
[Thousands more] [have taken] [to the] [streets in] [the last] [month in] [East Germany] ['s largest] [wave of] [domestic unrest] [since a] [workers '] [uprising in] [1953]
[In Washington] [the Bush] [administration took] [a characteristically] [cautious and] [skeptical view] [of the] [leadership change]
[The official] [line was] [to offer] [warmer ties] [to Mr.] [Krenz provided] [he is] [willing to] [institute reforms]
[U.S. officials] [have strong] [doubts that] [he is] [a reformer]
[President Bush] [told reporters] [Whether that] [the leadership] [change reflects] [a change] [in East-West] [relations I] [do n't] [think so]
[Because Mr.] [Krenz has] [been very] [much in] [accord with] [the policies] [of Honecker]
[One top] [U.S. expert] [on East] [Germany added] [There is] [no clear-cut] [champion of] [reform that] [we know] [of in] [the East] [German leadership]
[Indeed Mr.] [Krenz said] [on East] [German television] [last night] [that there] [will be] [no sharing] [of power] [with pro-democracy] [groups]
[He said] [while dialogue] [is important] [enough forums] [already exist] [in which] [different interests] [can express] [themselves]
[The removal] [of Mr.] [Honecker was] [apparently the] [result of] [bitter infighting] [within the] [top ranks] [of the] [Communist party]
[According to] [West German] [government sources] [Mr. Honecker] [several senior] [Politburo members] [fought over] [the last] [week to] [delay any] [decisions about] [a leadership] [change]
[with public] [demonstrations in] [the country] [growing in] [size and] [intensity Mr.] [Honecker several] [key allies] [lost out] [in this] [battle officials] [say]
[Those allies] [included who] [has long] [headed economic] [affairs ,] [and Joachim] [Hermann chief] [of information] [policy]
[Both men] [were also] [relieved of] [their duties] [yesterday]
[Although other] [resignations may] [follow it] ['s still] [clear to] [what extent] [the change] [in party] [personnel will] [alter the] [government 's] [resistance to] [fundamental change]
[Clearly the] [central figure] [in this] [process is] [Egon Krenz]
[Born in] [1937 in] [a Baltic] [Sea town] [now part] [of Poland] [he was] [eight years] [old when] [World War] [II ended]
[Like West] [German Chancellor] [Helmut Kohl] [he represents] [the postwar] [generation that] [has grown] [up during] [Germany 's] [division]
[Since joining] [the Politburo] [in 1983] [as its] [youngest member] [Mr. Krenz] [had acquired] [the nickname] [crown prince] [a reference] [to the] [widely held] [view that] [he was] [the hand-picked] [successor to] [Mr. Honecker]
[In fact] [the two] [men have] [had strikingly] [similar career] [paths both] [having served] [as chief] [of internal] [security before] [their rise] [to the] [top party] [position]
[Moreover both] [men have] [hewn to] [a similar] [hard-line philosophy]
[Notably one] [of Mr.] [Krenz 's] [few official] [visits overseas] [came a] [few months] [ago when] [he visited] [China after] [the massacre] [in Beijing]
[He later] [defended the] [Chinese government] ['s response] [during a] [separate visit] [to West] [Germany]
[East German] [Protestantism in] [particular fears] [Mr. Krenz] [in part] [because of] [an incident] [in January] [1988 when] [he was] [believed to] [have ordered] [the arrest] [of hundreds] [of dissidents] [who had] [sought refuge] [in the] [Church]
[However Mr.] [Krenz also] [has a] [reputation for] [being politically] [savvy]
[His shrewd] [ability to] [read the] [shifting popular] [mood in] [East Germany] [is best] [illustrated by] [his apparent] [break with] [his old] [mentor Mr.] [Honecker]
[Indeed according] [to West] [German government] [sources he] [was one] [of the] [leaders in] [the power] [struggle that] [toppled Mr.] [Honecker]
[In recent] [days Mr.] [Krenz has] [sought to] [project a] [kinder image]
[According to] [a report] [widely circulating] [in East] [Berlin it] [was Mr.] [Krenz who] [ordered police] [to stop] [using excessive] [force against] [demonstrators in] [Leipzig]
[He does] [n't want] [to have] [the image] [of the] [gun man] [says Fred] [Oldenburg an] [expert at] [the Bonn-sponsored] [Institute of] [East European] [and International] [Studies in] [Cologne]
[He 's] [a reformer] [he wants] [to have] [the image] [of a] [reformer]
[As part] [of his] [image polishing] [Mr. Krenz] [is expected] [to take] [modest steps] [toward reform] [to rebuild] [confidence among] [the people] [reassert the] [party 's] [authority]
[Besides sacking] [other senior] [Politburo officials] [who allied] [themselves with] [Mr. Honecker] [Mr. Krenz] [could loosen] [controls on] [the news] [media free] [up travel] [restrictions establish] [a dialogue] [with various] [dissident groups]
[it be] [enough]
[West German] [government officials] [Western analysts] [are doubtful]
[He does] [n't signify] [what people] [want the] [unrest will] [go on] [Mr. Oldenburg] [predicts]
[Last year] [when Northwest] [first offered] [the promotion] [only six] [centenarians flew] [free]
[If All] [Else Fails]
[THE NATION'S] [carriers also] [provide discounts] [to Red] [Cross workers] [retired military] [personnel medical] [students]
[There 's] [even a] [special fare] [for clergy] [that does] [n't require] [the usual] [stay over] [Saturday night]
[That way] [they can] [be home] [in time] [for work] [Sunday]
[The British] [Petroleum Co.] [PLC said] [its BP] [Exploration unit] [has produced] [the first] [oil from] [its Don] [oilfield in] [the North] [Sea]
[In an] [official release] [BP said] [initial production] [from the] [field was] [11,000 barrels] [a day] [that it] [expects peak] [output from] [the field] [of 15,000] [barrels a] [day to] [be reached] [in 1990]
[As the] [sponsor of] [to Work] [Act which] [would repeal] [the Social] [Security earnings] [limit for] [people aged] [65 older] [I applaud] [your strong] [endorsement to] [repeal this] [Depression-era fossil]
[For every] [dollar earned] [over $] [8,880 Social] [Security recipients] [lose 50] [cents of] [their Social] [Security benefits] [it 's] [like a] [50 %] [marginal tax]
[the compounded] [effects of] [`` seniors] [only ''] [taxes result] [in truly] [catastrophic marginal] [tax rates]
[Imagine a] [widow who] [wants to] [maintain her] [standard of] [living at] [the same] [level she] [had before] [she had] [to pay] [the catastrophic] [surtax]
[Although this] [widow earns] [only twice] [the minimum] [wage largely] [due to] [the earnings] [limit she] [would have] [to earn] [an additional] [$ 4,930] [to offset] [her catastrophic] [surtax of] [$ 496]
[Eliminating the] [earnings limit] [would greatly] [help seniors] [reduce the] [deficit]
[Repeal would] [generate more] [in new] [taxes than] [the government] [would lose] [in increased] [Social Security] [benefit payments]
[We now] [need support] [from the] [Democrats on] [the Rules] [Committee in] [to include] [earnings-limit reform] [in the] [Reconciliation Bill]
[Since all] [four Republicans] [on the] [committee are] [co-sponsors of] [my bill] [it is] [the Democrats] [who will] [be held] [fully accountable] [if an] [earnings test] [amendment is] [not allowed] [from the] [floor]
[The time] [is now] [to lift] [the burdensome] [Social Security] [earnings limit] [from the] [backs of] [our nation] ['s seniors]
[Rep. J.] [Dennis Hastert] [R. Ill]
[When his] [Seventh Avenue] [fur business] [here was] [flying high] [20 years] [ago Jack] [Purnick had] [25 workers] [a large] [factory]
[Now his] [half-dozen employees] [work in] [an eighth-floor] [shop that] [he says] [is smaller] [than his] [old storage] [room]
[He also] [says he] [is losing] [money now]
[He blames] [imports]
[just down] [Seventh Avenue] [where about] [75 %] [of U.S.] [fur garments] [are made] [Larry Rosen] [has acquired] [two retail] [outlets broadened] [his fur-making] [line expanded] [into leather]
[He credits] [imports]
[The difference] [lies in] [how the] [two entrepreneurial] [furriers reacted] [to the] [foreign competition] [and transformation] [of their] [industry over] [the past] [10 years]
[One stuck] [to old-line] [business traditions] [while the] [other embraced] [the change]
[The small] [, good] [fur salon] [is what] [it used] [to be] [says Mr.] [Purnick 75] [years old]
[We make] [the finest] [product in] [the world] [the Americans] [are being] [kicked around]
[Mr. Rosen] [though believes] [imports have] [reinvigorated the] [industry in] [which he] [has worked] [for most] [of his] [57 years]
[You 've] [got some] [minds here] [that wo] [n't think] [progressively he] [says]
[Import competition] [for U.S.] [furs has] [risen sharply] [since furriers] [started aggressively] [marketing working-girl] [mink similar] [lower-priced imported] [furs in] [recent years]
[Merchants discovered] [a consumer] [largely ignored] [by higher-priced] [furriers the] [younger woman] [even in] [her late] [20s who] [never thought] [she could] [buy a] [mink]
[The new] [market helped] [boost U.S.] [fur sales] [to about] [$ 1.8] [billion a] [year now] [triple the] [level in] [the late] [1970s]
[It also] [opened the] [door to] [furs made] [in South] [Korea China] [Hong Kong] [other countries]
[Jindo Furs] [a large] [South Korean] [maker says] [it operates] [35 retail] [outlets in] [the U.S.] [plans to] [open 15] [more by] [the end] [of next] [year]
[Mr. Purnick] [other old-line] [furriers call] [many of] [the the] [imports unstylish] [poorly made]
[High-end U.S.] [furriers say] [these imports] [have n't] [squeezed them]
[low-priced and] [middle-priced furriers] [like Mr.] [Purnick who] [once saturated] [the five-block] [Seventh Avenue] [fur district] [say imports] [have cut] [their sales]
[A woman] [who once] [would have] [saved for] [two or] [three seasons] [to buy] [a U.S.-made] [mink can] [now get] [an imported] [mink right] [away for] [less than] [$ 2,000]
[Mr. Rosen] [has turned] [the import] [phenomenon to] [his advantage]
[Early in] [the decade] [he saw] [that fur] [workers in] [many foreign] [countries were] [willing to] [work longer] [hours at] [lower wages] [than their] [American counterparts] [were more] [open to] [innovation]
[In 1982] [he started] [a factory] [in Greece]
[Two years] [later he] [opened one] [in West] [Germany]
[He also] [noticed that] [foreign makers] [were introducing] [many variations] [on the] [traditional fur] [he decided] [to follow] [suit]
[By combining] [his strengths] [in innovation] [quality control] [with the] [lower costs] [of production] [abroad he] [says he] [has been] [able to] [produce high-quality] [goods at] [low cost]
[To maintain] [control over] [production avoid] [overdependence on] [foreign sources] [he says] [he still] [makes most] [of his] [furs in] [the U.S.]
[six years] [ago he] [also began] [importing from] [the Far] [East]
[Inspired by] [imports Mr.] [Rosen now] [makes fur] [muffs ,] [hats and] [flings]
[This year] [he produced] [a men] ['s line] [offers dyed] [furs in] [red cherry] [red violet] [royal blue] [forest green]
[He has] [leather jackets] [from Turkey] [that are] [lined with] [eel skin] [topped off] [with raccoon-skin] [collars]
[From Asia] [he has] [mink jackets] [with floral] [patterns made] [by using] [different colored] [furs]
[Next he] [will be] [testing pictured] [embroidery called] [kalega made] [in the] [Far East]
[He plans] [to attach] [the embroidery] [to the] [backs of] [mink coats] [and jackets]
[Besides adding] [to sales] [leathers also] [attract retailers] [who may] [buy furs] [later he] [adds]
[Other furriers] [have also] [benefited from] [leathers]
[Seymour Schreibman] [the 65-year-old] [owner of] [Schreibman Raphael] [Furs Inc.] [treats the] [reverse side] [of a] [Persian lambskin] [to produce] [a reversible] [fur-and-leather garment]
[He says] [it accounts] [for 25] [% of] [total sales]
[Mr. Rosen] [is also] [pushing retail] [sales]
[This year] [he bought] [two stores] [one in] [Brooklyn one] [in Queens]
[Other furriers] [have also] [placed more] [weight on] [retailing]
[Golden Feldman] [Furs Inc.] [began retailing] [aggressively eight] [years ago] [now retail] [sales account] [for about] [20 %] [of gross] [income]
[In other] [moves Mr.] [Rosen says] [he bought] [a truck] [three years] [ago to] [reach more] [retailers]
[Since then] [he has] [expanded his] [fleet can] [now bring] [his furs] [to the] [front door] [of retailers] [as far] [away as] [the Midwest]
[Small retailers] [who ca] [n't afford] [to travel] [to his] [New York] [showroom have] [become fair] [game]
[Such moves] [have helped] [Mr. Rosen] [weather the] [industry slump] [of recent] [years]
[The industry] [enjoyed six] [prosperous years] [beginning in] [1980 since] [1986 sales] [have languished] [at their] [$ 1.8] [billion peak]
[Large furriers] [such as] [Antonovich Inc.] [Fur Vault] [Inc. Evans] [Inc. reported] [losses in] [their latest] [fiscal years]
[Aftereffects of] [the 1987] [stock market] [crash head] [the list] [of reasons]
[In addition] [competition has] [glutted the] [market with] [both skins] [and coats] [driving prices] [down]
[The animal-rights] [movement has] [n't helped] [sales]
[Warm winters] [over the] [past two] [years have] [trimmed demand] [too furriers] [complain]
[those who] [did n't] [move some] [production overseas] [suffer labor] [shortages]
[The intensive] [labor needed] [to manufacture] [furs in] [the U.S.] [is as] [available as] [it was] [says Mr.] [Schreibman who] [is starting] [overseas production]
[even those] [who have] [found a] [way to] [cope with] [the imports] [the slump] [fear that] [furs are] [losing part] [of their] [allure]
[People are] [promoting furs] [in various] [ways taking] [the glamour] [out of] [the fur] [business says] [Stephen Sanders] [divisional merchandise] [manager for] [Marshall Field] ['s department] [store in] [Chicago]
[You ca] [n't make] [a commodity] [out of] [a luxury] [insists Mr.] [Purnick the] [New York] [furrier]
[He contends] [that chasing] [consumers with] [low-priced imports] [will harm] [the industry] [in the] [long run] [by reducing] [the prestige] [of furs]
[Mr. Rosen] [responds Whatever] [people want] [to buy] [I 'll] [sell]
[The name] [of the] [game is] [to move] [goods]
[Four workers] [at GTE] [Corp. 's] [headquarters have] [been diagnosed] [as having] [hepatitis city] [health officials] [are investigating] [whether a] [cafeteria worker] [may have] [exposed hundreds] [of other] [GTE employees] [to the] [viral infection] [company and] [city officials] [said]
[The four] [cases were] [reported to] [GTE 's] [medical director] [state and] [local health] [authorities]
[GTE shut] [down its] [cafeteria Tuesday] [afternoon after] [testing determined] [that at] [least one] [cafeteria worker] [employed by] [GTE 's] [private food] [vending contractor] [ARA Services] [Inc. was] [suffering from] [a strain] [of the] [virus officials] [said]
[More than] [700 people] [work in] [the GTE] [building]
[The cafeteria] [remains closed]
[Dr. Andrew] [McBride city] [health director] [said his] [staff suspects] [the hepatitis] [which can] [be highly] [contagious was] [spread by] [the cafeteria] [worker with] [the virus]
[The exact] [strain of] [hepatitis that] [the cafeteria] [worker contracted] [has n't] [been determined] [should be] [known by] [the end] [of the] [week Dr.] [McBride said]
[Hepatitis A] [considered the] [least dangerous] [strain of] [the virus] [has been] [confirmed in] [at least] [one GTE] [employee company] [and city] [officials said]
[From a] [public health] [point of] [view we] ['re relieved] [because hepatitis] [A is] [rarely life-threatening] [said Dr.] [Frank Provato] [GTE 's] [medical director]
[It 's] [a double-edged] [sword though] [because it] [is also] [the most] [contagious kind] [of hepatitis]
[GTE officials] [began posting] [warning notices] [about the] [potential threat] [to exposure] [Wednesday morning] [at various] [places at] [the company] [said GTE] [spokesman Thomas] [Mattausch]
[The company] [has begun] [offering shots] [of gamma] [globulin which] [will diminish] [the flu-like] [symptoms of] [hepatitis A] [in anyone] [who has] [contracted the] [disease Mr.] [Mattausch said]
[We 're] [strongly recommending] [that anyone] [who has] [eaten in] [the cafeteria] [this month] [have the] [shot Mr.] [Mattausch added] [that means] [virtually everyone] [who works] [here]
[I was] [appalled to] [read the] [misstatements of] [facts in] [your Oct.] [13 editorial] [Colombia 's] [Brave Publisher]
[It is] [the right-wing] [guerrillas who] [are aligned] [with the] [drug traffickers] [the left] [wing]
[This information] [was gleaned] [from your] [own news] [stories on] [the region]
[Past Colombian] [government tolerance] [of the] [`` narcotraficantes] [was due] [to the] [drug lords] [' history] [of wiping] [out leftists] [in the] [hinterlands]
[Mary Poulin] [Palo Alto] [Calif.]
[I suggest] [that The] [Wall Street] [Journal as] [well as] [other U.S.] [news publications] [of like] [mind should] [put its] [money where] [its mouth] [is Lend] [computer equipment] [to replace] [that damaged] [at El] [Espectador buy] [ad space] [publish stories] [under the] [bylines of] [El Espectador] [journalists]
[We 've] [done a] [lot to] [improve results] [a lot] [more will] [be done] [Mr. Mark] [said]
[Improving profitability] [of U.S.] [operations is] [an extremely] [high priority] [in the] [company]
[Colgate 's] [results were] [at the] [high end] [of the] [range of] [analysts '] [forecasts]
[The scope] [of the] [improvement in] [the U.S.] [business caught] [some analysts] [by surprise]
[The company] ['s domestic] [business especially] [its household] [products division] [has performed] [poorly for] [years]
[Analysts say] [the earnings] [improvement came] [from cutting] [costs rather] [than increasing] [sales]
[For the] [nine months] [net increased] [14 %] [to $] [217.5 million] [$ 3.09] [a share]
[Sales rose] [7 %] [to $] [3.8 billion]
[The company] [earned $] [191.1 million] [$ 2.79] [a share] [in the] [year-earlier period]
[Colgate 's] [1988 net] [income included] [$ 40.1] [million 59] [cents a] [share from] [discontinued operations]
[Colgate sold] [its hospital] [supply and] [home health] [care business] [last year]
[Separately Colgate] [Wednesday finalized] [an agreement] [with MacroChem] [Corp. a] [tiny dental] [products and] [pharmaceutical concern] [based in] [Billerica Mass.] [to market] [in the] [U.S. four] [of MacroChem] ['s FDA-approved] [dental products]
[The products] [sealants bonding] [materials used] [by dentists] [contain fluoride] [that is] [released over] [time]
[The move] [is part] [of a] [drive to] [increase Colgate] ['s business] [with dentists] [a company] [spokeswoman said]
[Terms of] [the agreement] [were n't] [given]
[USACafes Limited] [Partnership said] [it completed] [the sale] [of its] [Bonanza restaurant] [franchise system] [to a] [subsidiary of] [Metromedia Co.] [for $] [71 million] [in cash]
[USACafes which] [is nearly] [half-owned by] [Sam and] [Charles Wyly] [of Dallas] [said it] [will distribute] [proceeds from] [the sale] [to unit] [holders as] [a liquidating] [dividend as] [soon as] [possible]
[The Bonanza] [franchise system] [which generates] [about $] [600 million] [in sales] [annually represented] [substantially all] [of the] [partnership 's] [assets]
[The sale] [of the] [system has] [been challenged] [in a] [class-action suit] [on behalf] [of unit] [holders filed] [last week] [in a] [Delaware court] [USACafes said]
[The company] [said it] [believes the] [suit is] [without merit]
[American Telephone] [& Telegraph] [Co. unveiled] [a sweetened] [pension early-retirement] [program for] [management that] [it hopes] [will enable] [it to] [save $] [450 million] [in the] [next year]
[AT&T also] [said net] [income rose] [19 %] [in the] [third quarter]
[AT&T said] [its amended] [pension program] [will nearly] [double to] [34,000 the] [number of] [managers eligible] [to retire] [with immediate] [pension payments]
[AT&T said] [that based] [on studies] [of other] [companies that] [have offered] [retirement plans] [it expects] [about one-third] [of its] [eligible managers] [to retire] [under the] [new program]
[AT&T said] [third-quarter net] [income grew] [despite stiff] [competition in] [all of] [the company] ['s markets]
[Net income] [rose to] [$ 699] [million 65] [cents a] [share from] [the year-earlier] [$ 587] [million 55] [cents a] [share]
[Revenue edged] [up to] [$ 8.9] [billion from] [$ 8.81] [billion]
[The latest] [period 's] [net was] [reduced $] [102 million] [nine cents] [a share] [for a] [change in] [depreciation method] [concurrent changes] [in estimates] [of depreciable] [lives net] [salvage for] [certain telecommunications] [equipment]
[The results] [roughly matched] [estimates of] [securities analysts] [who were] [encouraged by] [AT&T increasing] [its operating] [margin to] [13 %] [from 11] [% a] [year ago] [because of] [continued cost-cutting] [efforts]
[Sales of] [long-distance services] [an extremely] [competitive market] [rose 6.4] [%]
[the growth] [was partly] [offset by] [lower equipment] [sales and] [rentals price] [cuts on] [some products]
[Under the] [amended pension] [program AT&T] [managers who] [have at] [least five] [years of] [service will] [have five] [years added] [to their] [age and] [length of] [service for] [pension purposes]
[Managers who] [retire Dec.] [30 will] [have an] [additional 15] [% added] [to their] [monthly pension] [for as] [long as] [five years] [age 65] [whichever comes] [earlier]
[An AT&T] [spokeswoman said] [the company] [would likely] [replace about] [one-third of] [its managers] [who choose] [to retire] [with new] [employees]
[Analysts hailed] [the sweetened] [pension package] [which they] [said had] [been the] [subject of] [rumors for] [several months]
[This tells] [you AT&T] [is serious] [about continuing] [to manage] [their cost] [structure is] [committed to] [20%-a-year earnings] [growth said] [Jack Grubman] [an analyst] [with PaineWebber] [Inc]
[other analysts] [expressed disappointment] [that the] [cost-cutting move] [wo n't] [result in] [even greater] [earnings growth]
[This is] [a good] [move it] [only gets] [you to] [where people] ['s expectations] [already are] [in terms] [of earnings] [growth said] [Joel D.] [Gross an] [analyst with] [Donaldson ,] [Lufkin &] [Jenrette]
[Mr. Gross] [said he] [had hoped] [that a] [cost savings] [of $] [450 million] [would result] [in even] [greater growth] [than the] [20 %] [annual earnings] [increase AT&T] [has told] [analysts it] [expects in] [the future]
[AT&T said] [the special] [retirement option] [will increase] [fourth-quarter expenses]
[the company] [said the] [amount ca] [n't be] [determined until] [it knows] [how many] [managers opt] [to retire]
[AT&T said] [the expense] [increase will] [be largely] [offset by] [a gain] [from its] [previously announced] [plan to] [swap its] [holdings in] [Ing .] [C. Olivetti] [& Co.] [for shares] [in Cie] [. Industriali] [Riunite an] [Italian holding] [company]
[For the] [nine months] [AT&T said] [net income] [was $] [1.99 billion] [$ 1.85] [a share] [up 19] [% from] [$ 1.67] [billion $] [1.56 a] [share]
[Revenue gained] [3.1 %] [to $] [26.81 billion] [from $] [26 billion]

[When it] [comes to] [buying and] [selling shares] [Westridge Capital] [Management Inc.] [takes a] [back seat] [to no] [one]
[Every dollar] ['s worth] [of stock] [in the] [Los Angeles] [money manager] ['s portfolio] [is traded] [seven or] [eight times] [a year] [the firm] [estimates]
[That makes] [it the] [most active] [trader among] [the nation] ['s investment] [advisers according] [to Securities] [and Exchange] [Commission filings]
[wait a] [second]
[Westridge Capital] [is an] [index fund] [the type] [of stolid] [long-term investor] [whose goal] [is to] [be nothing] [more than] [average]
[Westridge Capital] ['s frenetic] [trading reflects] [the changes] [sweeping through] [the previously] [sleepy world] [of indexing]
[Indexing for] [the most] [part has] [involved simply] [buying then] [holding stocks] [in the] [correct mix] [to mirror] [a stock] [market barometer] [such as] [Standard Poor] ['s 500-stock] [index match] [its performance]
[Institutional investors] [have poured] [$ 210] [billion into] [stock and] [bond indexing] [as a] [cheap and] [easy form] [of investment] [management that] [promises to] [post average] [market returns]
[These big] [investors have] [flocked to] [indexing because] [relatively few] [`` active] ['' stock] [pickers have] [been able] [to consistently] [match the] [returns of] [the S&P] [500 other] [bellwethers much] [less beat] [it]
[the fees] [investors pay] [for indexing] [run a] [few pennies] [for each] [$ 100] [of assets] [a fraction] [of the] [cost of] [active managers]
[That 's] [because computers] [do most] [of the] [work low] [trading activity] [keeps a] [lid on] [commission costs]
[today indexing] [is moving] [from a] [passive investment] [strategy to] [an increasingly] [active one]
[Because index-fund] [managers are] [no longer] [satisfied with] [merely being] [average they] [have developed] [`` enhanced] ['' indexing] [strategies that] [are intended] [to outperform] [the market] [as much] [as three] [percentage points]
[Indexing has] [been the] [most single] [successful investment] [concept in] [the last] [decade the] [index money] [has been] [just sort] [of sitting] [there says] [Seth M.] [Lynn president] [of Axe] [Core Investors] [Inc. an] [indexer based] [in Tarrytown] [N.Y]
[Now the] [interest is] [in what] [else I] [do with] [that money]
[Futures and] [options also] [make it] [possible to] [build ``] [synthetic ''] [index funds] [that do] [n't actually] [own a] [single share] [of stock] [can produce] [returns that] [match or] [exceed the] [broad stock] [market]
[One reason] [for these] [hybrids is] [indexing 's] [rapid growth] [is slowing] [particularly for] [those ``] [plain vanilla] ['' funds] [that mirror] [the S&P] [500]
[There is] [a boatload] [of big] [investors out] [there still] [waiting to] [get into] [indexing says] [P. James] [Kartalia vice] [president of] [ANB Investment] [Management Co.] [Chicago which] [offers both] [indexing active] [management services]
[After tripling] [in size] [in the] [past five] [years index] [funds now] [hold about] [20 %] [of the] [stock owned] [by pension] [funds]
[A further] [problem is] [razor-thin profits]
[Plain-vanilla funds] [have become] [so commonplace] [that fees] [they can] [charge have] [plunged to] [almost nothing] [in some] [cases are] [just that]
[To land] [customers for] [their well-paying] [stock custodial] [business big] [banks sometimes] [will throw] [in basic] [indexing services] [for free]
[It 's] [like getting] [a free] [toaster when] [you open] [an account] [says Axe] [Core 's] [Mr. Lynn]
[As a] [result indexers] [have been] [looking for] [ways to] [give investors] [something more] [than the] [average for] [their money]
[many have] [been successful] [as in] [the case] [of the] [index fund] [operated by] [hyper-trader Westridge] [Capital]
[Westridge Capital] [has used] [enhanced indexing] [techniques to] [beat the] [S&P 500] ['s returns] [by 2.5] [to 3] [percentage points] [over the] [past four] [years with] [the same] [risk level] [as holding] [the S&P] [500 stocks] [according to] [James Carder] [the firm] ['s president]
[Strategies vary] [for Westridge] [Capital which] [has $] [300 million] [under management]
[The firm] [sometimes buys] [S&P 500] [futures when] [they are] [selling at] [a discount] [to the] [actual stocks] [will switch] [back and] [forth between] [stocks stock-index] [futures to] [take advantages] [of any] [momentary price] [discrepencies]
[Mr. Carder] [also goes] [through periods] [when he] [buys stocks] [in conjunction] [with options] [to boost] [returns protect] [against declines]
[in some] [months he] [buys stock-index] [futures and] [not stocks] [at all]
[By their] [nature our] [trades are] [very short-term] [and are] [going to] [create high] [turnover Mr.] [Carder adds]
[for our] [clients]
[Big indexer] [Bankers Trust] [Co. also] [uses futures] [in a] [strategy that] [on average] [has added] [one percentage] [point to] [its enhanced] [fund 's] [returns]
[J. Thomas] [Allen president] [of Pittsburgh-based] [Advanced Investment] [Management Inc.] [agrees it] ['s a] [good idea] [to jump] [between the] [S&P 500] [stocks and] [futures]
[You 're] [buying the] [S&P you] [always want] [to hold] [the cheapest] [form of] [it he] [says]
[some indexers] [make little] [or no] [use of] [futures saying] [that these] [instruments present] [added risks] [for investors]
[If the] [futures markets] [have a] [problem those] [products could] [have a] [problem says] [John Zumbrunn] [managing director] [of Prudential] [Insurance Co.] [of America] ['s Investment] [Index Technologies] [Inc. unit]
[Prudential currently] [is seeking] [approval to] [offer a] [new fund] [offering a] [return equal] [to the] [S&P 500] [index plus] [5\/100 of] [a percentage] [point]
[An added] [feature is] [that the] [slighty improved] [return would] [be guaranteed] [by Prudential]
[There are] [many other] [strategies to] [bolster the] [returns of] [index funds]
[They include]
[LIMITED RISK] [FUNDS]
[These guarantee] [protection against] [stock market] [declines while] [still passing] [along most] [gains]
[Here a] [fund may] [promise to] [pay back] [say $] [95 of] [every $] [100 invested] [for a] [year even] [if the] [market goes] [much lower]
[The fund] [could invest] [$ 87] [for one] [year in] [Treasury bills] [yielding 8] [% to] [return the] [guaranteed $] [95]
[That leaves] [$ 13] [which could] [be used] [to buy] [S&P 500] [options that] [will nearly] [match any] [gain in] [the S&P] [index]
[MANAGER REPLICATION] [FUNDS]
[Say a] [big investor] [is interested] [in growth] [stocks]
[Instead of] [hiring one] [of the] [many active] [managers specializing] [in growth] [stocks indexers] [can design] [a portfolio] [around the] [same stocks] [the portfolio] [will be] [maintained by] [computer reducing] [both fees] [in theory] [risk because] [of the] [large number] [of stocks]
[We see] [a lot] [of interest] [in those] [kind of] [things says] [Frank Salerno] [a vice] [president of] [Bankers Trust]
[People comfortable] [with the] [passive approach] [are using] [them for] [other strategies]
[TILT FUNDS]
[This is] [an index] [fund with] [a bet]
[Instead of] [replicating the] [S&P 500] [some other] [index exactly] [some stocks] [are overweighted] [or underweighted] [in the] [portfolio]
[One simple] [approach is] [to exclude] [S&P 500] [companies considered] [bankruptcy candidates] [this can] [avoid weak] [sisters also] [can hurt] [when a] [company like] [Chrysler Corp.] [rebounds]
[Another approach] [An investor] [with $] [100 million] [might use] [$ 75] [million to] [buy the] [S&P 500] [index spend] [the other] [$ 25] [million on] [a favorite] [group of] [stocks]
[SPECIALIZED FUNDS]
[Indexes can] [be constructed] [to serve] [social goals] [such as] [eliminating the] [stocks of] [companies doing] [business in] [South Africa]
[Other funds] [have been] [designed to] [concentrate on] [stocks in] [a geographic] [area in] [to encourage] [local investment]
[Pennsylvania State] [Employees Retirement] [System for] [example has] [about $] [130 million] [invested in] [a fund] [of 244] [companies that] [are either] [Pennsylvania-based have] [25 %] [of their] [work forces] [in the] [state]
[Short interest] [on the] [New York] [Stock Exchange] [declined for] [the second] [consecutive month] [this time] [4.2 %] [while the] [American Stock] [Exchange reported] [its third] [consecutive record] [month of] [short interest]
[The Big] [Board reported] [short interest] [dropped to] [523,920,214 shares] [as of] [Oct. 13] [from 547,347,585] [shares in] [mid-September]
[Amex short] [interest climbed] [3 %] [to 53,496,665] [shares from] [51,911,566 shares]
[For the] [year-earlier month] [the Big] [Board reported] [461,539,056 shares] [indicating a] [13.5 %] [year-to-year rise] [while the] [Amex reported] [36,015,194 shares] [a 48] [% leap]
[Amex short] [interest has] [been heading] [upward since] [mid-December with] [increases in] [each month] [since then] [except at] [mid-July]
[Traders who] [sell short] [borrow stock] [sell it] [betting that] [the stock] ['s price] [will decline] [that they] [can buy] [the shares] [back later] [at a] [lower price] [for return] [to the] [lender]
[Short interest] [is the] [number of] [shares that] [have n't] [yet been] [purchased for] [return to] [lenders]
[Although a] [substantial short] [position reflects] [heavy speculation] [that a] [stock 's] [price will] [decline some] [investors consider] [an increase] [in short] [interest bullish] [because the] [borrowed shares] [eventually must] [be bought] [back]
[Fluctuation in] [short interest] [of certain] [stocks also] [may be] [caused partly] [by arbitraging]
[The figures] [occasionally include] [incomplete transactions] [in restricted] [stock]
[The level] [of negative] [sentiment measured] [by the] [Big Board] [short interest] [ratio slipped] [to 3.36] [from last] [month 's] [3.38]
[The ratio] [is the] [number of] [trading days] [at the] [exchange 's] [average trading] [volume that] [would be] [required to] [convert the] [total short] [interest position]
[Some analysts] [suggest however] [that the] [ratio has] [weakened in] [value as] [an indicator] [because options] [other products] [can be] [used to] [hedge short] [positions]

[Your Oct.] [12 editorial] [Pitiful ,] [Helpless Presidency] [correctly states] [that I] [was critical] [of the] [Bush administration] ['s failure] [to have] [any plan] [in place] [to respond] [in a] [timely fashion] [to the] [opportunities to] [oust Manuel] [Noriega presented] [by the] [attempted military] [coup on] [Oct. 3]
[You are] [absolutely wrong] [however in] [opining that] [this position] [is some] [kind of] [flip-flop something] [newly arrived] [at as] [a result] [of reading] [the opinion] [polls]
[My position] [is one] [founded on] [both the] [facts the] [law]
[Although you] [may have] [forgotten public] [opinion about] [Gen. Noriega] [is where] [it is] [in large] [measure because] [of my] [investigation of] [his years] [of involvement] [in narcotics] [smuggling simultaneous] [work as] [a U.S.] [operative]
[The public] [made up] [its mind] [about Gen.] [Noriega largely] [as a] [result of] [the hearings] [I chaired] [in the] [Subcommittee on] [Terrorism and] [Narcotics of] [the Foreign] [Relations Committee] [on Feb.] [8 ,] [9 ,] [10 and] [11 ,] [1988 ,] [and again] [on April] [4 ,] [1988]
[It was] [during those] [hearings that] [the nation] [first learned] [the breadth] [and depth] [of Gen.] [Noriega 's] [criminality ,] [and of] [his enduring] [relationships with] [a variety] [of U.S.] [government agencies]
[Those hearings] [also highlighted] [how Gen.] [Noriega was] [able to] [use his] [relationships with] [these agencies] [to delay] [U.S. action] [against him] [to exploit] [the administration] ['s obsession] [with overthrowing] [the Sandinistas] [to protect] [his own] [drug-dealing]
[As to] [Costa Rica] [Francis J.] [McNeil testified] [before the] [subcommittee the] [Reagan administration] [knew that] [Gen. Noriega] [was involved] [with narcotics] [made a] [decision in] [the summer] [of 1986] [to put] [Gen. Noriega] [on the] [shelf until] [Nicaragua was] [settled]
[As the] [report issued] [by the] [subcommittee concluded] [Our government] [did nothing] [regarding Gen.] [Noriega 's] [drug business] [substantial criminal] [involvement because] [the first] [priority was] [the Contra] [war]
[This decision] [resulted in] [at least] [some drugs] [entering the] [United States] [as a] [hidden cost] [of the] [war]
[Unfortunately this] [problem continued] [even after] [Gen. Noriega] ['s indictment]
[Throughout 1988] [this year] [I others] [in Congress] [have pressed] [the U.S.] [to develop] [a plan] [for pushing] [this ``] [narcokleptocrat out] [of Panama]
[Regrettably two] [administrations in] [a row] [have been] [unwilling and] [unable to] [develop any] [plan military] [or economic] [for supporting] [the Panamanian] [people in] [their attempts] [to restore] [democracy]
[Sen. John] [Kerry D.] [Mass]
[For Vietnamese] [these are] [often treacherous] [times]
[After years] [of hesitation] [economic and] [political reform] [was embraced] [at the] [end of] [1986 ringing] [declarations have] [yet to] [be translated] [into much] [action]
[Vietnam is] [finding that] [turning a] [stagnant socialist] [order into] [a dynamic] [free market] [does n't] [come easy]
[Here is] [how three] [Vietnamese are] [coping with] [change]
[The Tire] [King]
[Nguyen Van] [Chan is] [living proof] [that old] [ways die] [hard]
[Mr. Chan] [used to] [be an] [oddity in] [Hanoi a] [private entrepreneur]
[His business] [success made] [him an] [official target] [in pre-reform] [days]
[Mr. Chan] [now 64] [years old] [invented a] [fountain pen] [he his] [family produced] [from plastic] [waste]
[Later he] [marketed glue]
[Both products] [were immensely] [popular]
[For his] [troubles Mr.] [Chan was] [jailed three] [times between] [1960 and] [1974]
[Though his] [operation was] [registered used] [only scrap] [he was] [accused of] [conducting illegal] [business possessing] [illegal materials]
[Once he] [was held] [for three] [months without] [being charged]
[Things were] [supposed to] [change when] [Vietnam 's] [economic reforms] [gathered pace] [for awhile] [they did]
[After years] [of experimenting] [Mr. Chan] [produced a] [heavy-duty bicycle] [tire that] [outlasted its] [state-produced rival]
[By 1982] [he was] [selling thousands] [of tires]
[Newspapers published] [articles about] [him he] [was hailed] [as the] [tire king]
[His efforts] [earned a] [gold medal] [at a] [national exhibition] [attracted renewed] [attention from] [local authorities]
[District police] [in 1983] [descended on] [his suburban] [home which] [he his] [large family] [used as] [both residence] [and factory] [demanded proof] [the house] [and equipment] [were his]
[He produced] [it]
[That was] [the first] [time they] [lost I] [won he] [says]
[He was] [further questioned] [to determine] [if he] [was a] [real working] [man an] [exploiter]
[Says Mr.] [Chan When] [I showed] [it was] [from my] [own brain] [they lost] [for the] [second time]
[a few] [days later] [the police] [accused him] [of stealing] [electricity acquiring] [rubber without] [permission buying] [stolen property]
[Warned he] [was to] [be jailed] [again he] [fled to] [the countryside]
[His family] [was given] [three hours] [to leave] [the house] [and contents] [were confiscated]
[With only] [the clothes] [they were] [wearing family] [members moved] [to a] [home owned] [by one] [of Mr.] [Chan 's] [sons]
[After six] [months on] [the run] [Mr. Chan] [learned the] [order for] [his arrest] [had been] [canceled]
[He rejoined] [his family] [in January] [1984 began] [the long] [struggle for] [justice pressing] [everyone from] [Hanoi municipal] [officials to] [National Assembly] [deputies for] [restoration of] [his rights]
[He his] [family kept] [afloat by] [repairing bicycles] [selling fruit] [doing odd] [jobs]
[Mr. Chan] [achieved a] [breakthrough in] [1987 became] [a minor] [celebrity again] [when his] [story was] [published in] [a weekly] [newspaper]
[In 1988] [18 months] [the sixth] [congress formally] [endorsed family-run] [private enterprise] [district authorities] [allowed Mr.] [Chan to] [resume work]
[By late] [last year] [he was] [invited back] [as the] [tire king] [to display] [his products] [at a] [national exhibition]
[National leaders] [stopped by] [his stand] [to commend] [his achievements]
[Mr. Chan] [now produces] [1,000 bicycle] [and motorbike] [tires a] [month 1,000] [tins of] [tire-patching glue] [in the] [son 's] [small house]
[Eighteen people] [pack the] [house 's] [two rooms] [the Chans] [four of] [their 10] [children with] [spouses eight] [of 22] [grandchildren]
[Most sleep] [on the] [floor]
[Come daybreak] [eight family] [members two] [other workers] [unroll a] [sheet of] [raw rubber] [that covers] [the floor] [of the] [house spills] [out onto] [the street]
[The primitive] [operations also] [burst out] [the back] [door into] [a small] [courtyard where] [an ancient] [press squeezes] [rubber solution] [into a] [flat strip] [newly made] [tires are] [cooled in] [a bathtub] [filled with] [water]
[Mr. Chan] [talks optimistically] [of expanding] [maybe even] [moving into] [the import-export] [field]
[First however] [he has] [unfinished business]
[When district] [authorities allowed] [him to] [resume manufacturing] [they released] [only one] [of his] [machines]
[They did] [n't return] [the rubber] [stocks that] [represent his] [capital]
[they return] [his house] [and contents] [which he] [values at] [about $] [44,000]
[He wants] [to recover] [more than] [just his] [property though]
[I want] [my dignity] [back he] [says]

[An accelerating] [move by] [personal computer] [manufacturers '] [to include] [advanced graphics] [capabilities as] [standard equipment] [further dampened] [reseller purchases] [of Western] [Digital 's] [equipment]
[The other] [areas of] [the business] [storage and] [microcomputers were] [very good] [Mr. Johnson] [said]
[He said] [Western Digital] [has reacted] [swiftly to] [the movement] [to video] [graphics array] [graphics technology] [from EGA] [which has] [a lower] [resolution standard] [technology now] [is one] [of the] [leading producers] [of these] [newer units]
[Other makers] [of video] [controller equipment] [also were] [caught in] [the EGA-VGA] [shift he] [said we] [were able] [to respond] [much more] [quickly]
[Still Mr.] [Johnson said] [our stock] [is grossly] [undervalued]
[He said] [the company] [has cut] [operating expenses] [by about] [10 %] [over the] [last few] [quarters while] [maintaining research] [and development] [at about] [8 %] [to 9] [% of] [sales]
[As part] [of its] [reorganization this] [week Western] [Digital has] [divided its] [business into] [two segments] [storage products] [including controllers] [disk drives] [microcomputer products] [which include] [graphics ,] [communications and] [peripheral control] [chips]
[Graphics ,] [communications and] [peripheral control] [chips were] [combined because] [increasingly multiple] [functions are] [being governed] [by a] [single chip]
[Storage which] [includes computer] [controllers 3.5-inch] [disk drives] [represents nearly] [two-thirds of] [the company] ['s business]
[Disk drives] [which allow] [a computer] [to access] [its memory] [generated 38] [% more] [revenue in] [the most] [recent period] [compared with] [the fiscal] [first quarter] [a year] [earlier]
[Computer parts] [are getting] [ever smaller] [Mr. Johnson] [said a] [shrinking that] [has propelled] [laptops into] [position as] [the fastest-growing] [segment of] [the computer] [business]
[As smaller] [and more] [powerful computers] [continue to] [be the] [focus of] [the industry] [he said] [Western Digital] [is strengthening] [development of] [laptop parts]
[Next year] [Western Digital] [plans to] [consolidate its] [operations from] [11 buildings] [in Irvine] [into two] [buildings in] [the same] [city a] [new headquarters] [a block] [away a] [modern $] [100 million] [silicon wafer] [fabrication plant]
[The plan] [will help] [the company] [in its] [existing joint] [manufacturing agreement] [with AT&T]
[About half] [of Western] [Digital 's] [business is] [overseas Mr.] [Johnson expects] [that proportion] [to continue]
[Plans to] [dissolve many] [of the] [trade barriers] [within Europe] [in 1992] [creates significant] [opportunities for] [the company] [he said] [particularly since] [Western Digital] [already manufactures] [there]
[Capitalizing on] [that presence] [Western Digital] [is launching] [a major] [effort to] [develop the] [embryonic reseller] [market in] [Europe]
[Directors of] [state-owned Banca] [Nazionale del] [Lavoro approved] [a two-step] [capital-boosting transaction] [a change] [in the] [bank 's] [rules that] [will help] [it operate] [more like] [a private-sector] [institution]
[Until now] [BNL 's] [top managers] [its directors] [have been] [appointed by] [a Treasury] [decree]
[under the] [bank 's] [proposed statutes] [an assembly] [of shareholders] [must approve] [board members]
[The bank] ['s chairman] [and director] [general who] [also sit] [on the] [board still] [would be] [appointed by] [the Treasury]
[BNL which] [is controlled] [by the] [Italian Treasury] [was rocked] [by the] [disclosure last] [month that] [its Atlanta] [branch extended] [more than] [$ 3] [billion in] [unauthorized credits] [to Iraq]
[The ensuing] [scandal in] [which the] [bank 's] [management resigned] [has helped] [renew calls] [for privatization] [at least] [an overhaul] [of Italy] ['s banking] [system which] [is about] [80 %] [state-controlled]
[In a] [related move] [the bank] [also proposed] [that board] [representation be] [linked more] [closely to] [the bank] ['s new] [shareholding structure]
[BNL called] [a shareholders] [' assembly] [meeting in] [December to] [vote on] [the proposals]
[BNL has] [about 75,000] [nonvoting shares] [that are] [listed on] [the Milan] [Stock Exchange]
[The shares] [were suspended] [from trading] [following disclosure] [of the] [Atlanta scandal] [Consob the] [stock exchange] [regulatory body] [reportedly will] [decide soon] [whether to] [end the] [trading suspension]

[As the] [Hunt brothers] [' personal] [bankruptcy cases] [sputter into] [their second] [year Minpeco] [S.A. has] [proposed a] [deal to] [settle its] [huge claim] [against the] [troubled Texas] [oil men]
[the plan] [only threatens] [to heighten] [the tension] [and confusion] [already surrounding] [the cases] [that were] [filed in] [September 1988]
[The Peruvian] [mineral concern] ['s $] [claim stems] [from 1988] [jury award] [in a] [case stemming] [from the] [brothers '] [alleged attempts] [to corner] [the 1979-80] [silver market]
[Minpeco now] [says it] [is willing] [to settle] [for up] [to $] [65.7 million] [from each] [brother although] [the actual] [amount would] [probably be] [much less]
[Although the] [proposal must] [be approved] [by federal] [Judge Harold] [C. Abramson] [W. Herbert] [Hunt has] [agreed to] [the Peruvian] [mineral concern] ['s proposal]
[Nelson Bunker] [Hunt is] [considering it] [although his] [attorney says] [he wo] [n't do] [it if] [the proposal] [jeopardizes a] [tentative settlement] [he has] [reached with] [the Internal] [Revenue Service] [which claims] [the brothers] [owe $] [1 billion] [in back] [taxes is] [by far] [the biggest] [creditor in] [both cases]
[The tentative] [agreement between] [the IRS] [Nelson Bunker] [Hunt is] [awaiting U.S.] [Justice Department] [approval]
[Under it] [the former] [billionaire 's] [assets would] [be liquidated] [with the] [IRS getting] [80 %] [of the] [proceeds the] [rest being] [divided among] [other creditors] [including Minpeco] [Manufacturers Hanover] [Trust Co.] [which is] [seeking repayment] [of a] [$ 36] [million loan]
[A similiar] [proposal has] [been made] [in the] [W. Herbert] [Hunt case] [although he] [the IRS] [are at] [odds over] [the size] [of the] [non-dischargable debt] [he would] [have to] [pay to] [the government] [from future] [earnings]
[In both] [cases Minpeco] [Manufacturers Hanover] [have been] [fighting ferociously] [over their] [shares of] [the pie]
[With support] [from the] [IRS Manufacturers] [Hanover has] [filed suit] [asking Judge] [Abramson to] [subordinate Minpeco] ['s claim] [to those] [of Manufacturer] [Hanover the] [IRS]
[Minpeco has] [threatened a] [`` volcano] [of litigation] [if the] [Manufacturers Hanover] [Corp. unit] [attempts to] [force such] [a plan] [through the] [court]
[Minpeco said] [it would] [n't pursue] [such litigation] [if its] [settlement plan] [in the] [W. Herbert] [Hunt case] [is approved] [by Judge] [Abramson who] [will consider] [the proposal] [at a] [hearing next] [week]
[Minpeco attorney] [Thomas Gorman] [decribed the] [plan as] [one step] [toward an] [overall settlement] [of the] [W. Herbert] [Hunt case] [Hugh Ray] [attorney for] [Manufacturers Hanover] [called it] [silly said] [he would] [fight it] [in court]
[The thing] [is so] [fluid right] [now that] [there 's] [really no] [way to] [say what] [will happen] [says Justice] [Department attorney] [Grover Hartt] [III who] [represents the] [IRS in] [the case]
[Developments like] [this are] [hard to] [predict]
[Banc One] [Corp. said] [it agreed] [in principle] [to buy] [five branch] [offices from] [Trustcorp Inc.] [Toledo Ohio] [following the] [planned merger] [of Trustcorp] [into Society] [Corp. Cleveland]
[The five] [offices in] [Erie and] [Ottawa counties] [in northern] [Ohio have] [total assets] [of about] [$ 88] [million Banc] [One said]
[The purchase] [price will] [be established] [after Banc] [One has] [an opportunity] [to study] [the quality] [of the] [assets Banc] [One said]
[Society Corp.] [already has] [branches in] [the area] [selling the] [Trustcorp offices] [could avoid] [a problem] [with regulators] [over excessive] [concentration of] [banking in] [the two] [counties after] [the merger] [of Trustcorp] [into Society] [according to] [industry sources]
[The merger] [is scheduled] [to take] [place in] [the 1990] [first quarter]
[Stock-market fears] [relatively more] [attractive interest] [rates pushed] [money-market mutual] [fund assets] [up $] [6.07 billion] [in the] [latest week] [the sharpest] [increase in] [almost two] [years]
[The 473] [funds tracked] [by the] [Investment Company] [Institute a] [Washington-based trade] [group rose] [to $] [356.1 billion] [a record]
[The $] [6.07 billion] [increase was] [the strongest] [weekly inflow] [since January] [1988]
[The increase] [was spread] [fairly evenly] [among all] [three types] [of funds]
[Individual investors] [represented in] [the general-purpose] [and broker-dealer] [fund categories] [pulled money] [from the] [stock market] [after its] [big drop] [last Friday] [put the] [money into] [funds said] [Jacob Dreyer] [vice president] [chief economist] [of the] [Institute]
[Insitutional investors] [on the] [other hand] [reacted to] [the steep] [decline in] [yields on] [direct money-market] [instruments following] [the stock-market] [decline last] [Friday Mr.] [Dreyer said]
[Yields on] [money funds] [dropped in] [the week] [ended Tuesday] [according to] [Donoghue 's] [Money Fund] [Report a] [Holliston ,] [Mass. ,] [newsletter]
[The average] [seven-day compounded] [yield fell] [to 8.55] [% from] [8.60 %] [the week] [earlier Donoghue] ['s said]
[At the] [auction of] [six-month U.S.] [Treasury bills] [on Monday] [the average] [yield fell] [to 7.61] [% from] [7.82 %]
[Likewise certificates] [of deposit] [on average] [posted lower] [yields in] [the week] [ended Tuesday]
[The 142] [institutional-type money] [funds rose] [$ 2.23] [billion to] [$ 85.49] [billion]
[The 235] [general-purpose funds] [increased $] [2.53 billion] [to $] [116.56 billion] [while 96] [broker-dealer funds] [increased $] [1.3 billion] [to $] [154.05 billion]
[Domestic lending] [for real] [estate and] [property development] [was the] [source of] [Bank Bumiputra] [Malaysia Bhd.] ['s most] [recent spate] [of financial] [troubles the] [institution 's] [executive chairman] [Mohamed Basir] [Ismail said]
[Speaking to] [reporters this] [week after] [Bank Bumiputra] ['s shareholders] [approved a] [rescue plan] [Tan Sri] [Basir said] [heavy lending] [to the] [property sector] [rocked the] [bank when] [property prices] [in Malaysia] [plummeted in] [1984-85]
[He said] [the bank] [could n't] [wait any] [longer for] [prices to] [recover for] [borrowers to] [service their] [loans]
[the bank] ['s board] [decided to] [make 1.23] [billion Malaysian] [dollars US$] [457 million] [in provisions] [for interest] [payments from] [loans previously] [recorded as] [revenue never] [actually received] [by the] [bank to] [submit a] [bailout package] [to replenish] [the bank] ['s paid-up] [capital]
[The predicament] [he added] [was similar] [to the] [Hong Kong] [1982-83 property-price] [collapse which] [exposed the] [involvement of] [Bank Bumiputra] ['s former] [subsidiary in] [the colony] [in the] [largest banking] [scandal in] [Malaysia 's] [history]
[The subsidiary] [Bumiputra Malaysia] [Finance Ltd.] [was left] [with M$] [2.26 billion] [in bad] [loans made] [to Hong] [Kong property] [speculators]
[Both episodes] [wiped out] [Bank Bumiputra] ['s shareholders] [' funds]
[Each time] [the bank] ['s 90] [% shareholder] [Petroliam Nasional] [Bhd. Petronas] [the national] [oil company] [has been] [called upon] [to rescue] [the institution]
[In five] [years Petronas] [which became] [the dominant] [shareholder in] [a 1984] [rescue exercise] [has spent] [about M$] [3.5 billion] [to prop] [up the] [troubled bank]
[Tan Sri] [Basir said] [the capital] [restructuring plan] [has been] [approved by] [Malaysia 's] [Capital Issues] [Committee and] [central bank]
[Malaysia 's] [High Court] [is expected] [to approve] [the plan]
[the plan] [is approved] [Tan Sri] [Basir said] [most of] [Bank Bumiputra] ['s nonperforming] [loans will] [have been] [fully provided] [for the] [bank will] [be on] [track to] [report a] [pretax profit] [of between] [M$ 160] [million and] [M$ 170] [million for] [the fiscal] [year ending] [March 31]
[For the] [previous financial] [year the] [bank would] [have reported] [a pretax] [profit of] [M$ 168] [million if] [it had] [n't made] [provisions for] [the nonperforming] [loans he] [said]
[Malaysia 's] [Banking Secrecy] [Act prohibited] [the bank] [from identifying] [delinquent borrowers] [said Tan] [Sri Basir]
[public documents] [indicate 10] [% or] [more of] [the bank] ['s provisions] [were made] [for foregone] [interest on] [a M$] [200 million] [loan to] [Malaysia 's] [dominant political] [party the] [United Malays] [National Organization] [to build] [its convention] [and headquarters] [complex in] [Kuala Lumpur]
[The loan] [to UMNO] [was made] [in September] [1983]
[We lent] [a lot] [of money] [all over] [the place] [said Tan] [Sri Basir] [who refused] [to discuss] [the bank] ['s outstanding] [loans]
[As well] [as the] [M$ 1.23] [billion in] [provisions announced] [on Oct.] [6 the] [restructuring package] [covers an] [additional M$] [450 million] [in provisions] [made in] [earlier years] [never reflected] [in a] [reduction of] [the bank] ['s paid-up] [capital]
[At the] [end of] [the exercise] [the cash] [injection from] [Petronas will] [increase the] [bank 's] [paid-up capital] [to M$] [1.15 billion] [after virtually] [being wiped] [out by] [the new] [provisions]
[Heidi Ehman] [might have] [stepped from] [a recruiting] [poster for] [young Republicans]
[White 24] [years old] [a singer] [in her] [church choir] [she symbolizes] [a generation] [that gave] [its heart] [its vote] [to Ronald] [Reagan]
[I felt] [kind of] [safe she] [says]
[No longer]
[When the] [Supreme Court] [opened the] [door this] [year to] [new restrictions] [on abortion] [Ms. Ehman] [opened her] [mind to] [Democratic politics]
[Then a] [political novice] [she stepped] [into a] [whirl of] [`` pro-choice] ['' marches] [house parties] [fund-raisers]
[Now she] [leads a] [grassroots abortion-rights] [campaign in] [Passaic County] [for pro-choice] [Democratic gubernatorial] [candidate James] [Florio]
[This is] [one where] [I cross] [party lines] [she says] [rejecting the] [anti-abortion stance] [of Rep.] [Florio 's] [opponent Reagan-Republican] [Rep. James] [Courter]
[People my] [age thought] [it was] [n't going] [to be] [an issue]
[Now it] [has especially] [for people] [my age]
[Polls bear] [out this] [warning after] [a decade] [of increased] [Republican influence] [here the] [new politics] [of abortion] [have contributed] [to a] [world turned] [upside down] [for Mr.] [Courter]
[Unless he] [closes the] [gap Republicans] [risk losing] [not only] [the governorship] [but also] [the assembly] [next month]
[Going into] [the 1990s] [the GOP] [is paying] [a price] [for the] [same conservative] [social agenda] [that it] [used to] [torment Democrats] [in the] [past]
[This change] [comes less] [from a] [shift in] [public opinion] [which has] [n't changed] [much on] [abortion over] [the past] [decade than] [in the] [boundaries of] [the debate]
[New Jersey] ['s own] [highest court] [remains a] [liberal bulwark] [against major] [restrictions on] [abortion the] [U.S. Supreme] [Court ruling] [Webster vs.] [Missouri has] [engaged voters] [across the] [nation who] [had been] [insulated from] [the issue]
[Before July] [pro-choice voters] [could safely] [make political] [decisions without] [focusing narrowly] [on abortion]
[Now the] [threat of] [further restrictions] [adds a] [new dimension] [bringing an] [upsurge in] [political activity] [by abortion-rights] [forces]
[A recent] [pro-choice rally] [in Trenton] [drew thousands] [in a] [major reversal] [Congress is] [defying a] [presidential veto] [demanding that] [Medicaid abortions] [be permitted] [in cases] [of rape] [and incest]
[If Webster] [had n't] [happened you] [would n't] [be here] [Linda Bowker] [tells a] [reporter in] [the Trenton] [office of] [the National] [Organization for] [Women]
[We could] [have shouted] [from the] [rooftops about] [Courter no] [one would] [have heard] [us]
[New Jersey] [is a] [proving ground] [for this] [aggressive women's-rights] [movement this] [year]
[The infusion] [of activists] [can bring] [a clash] [of cultures]
[In Cherry] [Hill the] [National Abortion] [Rights Action] [League whose] [goal is] [to sign] [up 50,000] [pro-choice voters] [targets a] [union breakfast] [to build] [labor support] [for its] [cause]
[The league] [organizers seem] [more a] [fit with] [a convention] [next door] [of young] [aerobics instructors] [in leotards] [than the] [beefy union] [leaders I] [wish I] [could go] [work out] [says a] [slim activist]
[A labor] [chief speaks] [sardonically of] [having to] [`` man] [and woman] [Election Day] [phones]
[No age] [group is] [more sensitive] [than younger] [voters like] [Ms. Ehman]
[A year] [ago this] [fall New] [Jersey voters] [under 30] [favored George] [Bush by] [56 %] [to 39] [% over] [Michael Dukakis] [according to] [a survey] [then by] [Rutgers University] ['s Eagleton] [Institute]
[A matching] [Eagleton-Newark Star] [Ledger poll] [last month] [showed a] [complete reversal]
[Voters in] [the same] [age group] [backed Democrat] [Florio 55] [% to] [29 %] [over Republican] [Courter]
[Abortion alone] [ca n't] [explain this] [shift New] [Jersey is] [a model] [of how] [so personal] [an issue] [can become] [a baseline] [of sorts] [in judging] [a candidate]
[By a] [2-to-1 ratio] [voters appear] [more at] [ease with] [Mr. Florio] ['s stance] [on abortion] [polls indicate] [his lead] [widens when] [the candidates] [are specifically] [linked to] [the issue]
[The times] [are my] [times says] [Mr. Florio]
[The Camden] [County congressman] [still carries] [himself with] [a trademark] [`` I'm-coming-down-your-throat] ['' intensity] [at a] [pause in] [Newark 's] [Columbus Day] [parade recently] [he was] [dancing with] [his wife] [in the] [middle of] [the avenue] [in the] [city 's] [old Italian-American] [ward]
[After losing] [by fewer] [than 1,800] [votes in] [governor 's] [race he] [has prepared] [himself methodically] [for this] [moment including] [deciding in] [recent years] [he could] [no longer] [support curbs] [on federal] [funding for] [Medicaid abortions]
[If you] ['re going] [to be] [consistent say] [it is] [a constitutionally] [protected right] [he asks] [how you] [going to] [say an] [upscale woman] [who can] [drive to] [the hospital] [or clinic] [in a] [nice car] [has a] [constitutional right] [someone who] [is in] [great shape] [financially does]
[Mr. Courter] [by comparison] [seems a] [shadow of] [the confident] [hawk who] [defended Oliver] [North before] [national cameras] [at Iran-Contra] [hearings two] [years ago]
[Looking back] [he says] [he erred] [by stating] [his ``] [personal ''] [opposition to] [abortion instead] [of assuring] [voters that] [he would] [n't impose] [his views] [on policy] [as governor]
[It is] [a distinction] [that satisfies] [neither side] [in the] [debate]
[He does] [n't know] [himself Kathy] [Stanwick of] [the Abortion] [Rights League] [says of] [Mr. Courter] ['s position]
[Even abortion] [opponents however] [angry with] [Mr. Florio] [ca n't] [hide their] [frustration with] [the Republican] ['s ambivalence]
[He does] [n't want] [to lead] [the people] [says Richard] [Traynor president] [of New] [Jersey Right] [to Life]
[Moreover by] [stepping outside] [the state] ['s pro-choice] [tradition Mr.] [Courter aggravates] [fears that] [he is] [too conservative] [as well] [on more] [pressing concerns] [such as] [auto insurance] [rates the] [environment]
[He hurt] [himself further] [this summer] [by bringing] [homosexual issues] [into the] [debate by] [wavering on] [this issue] [abortion he] [has weakened] [his credibility] [in what] [is already] [a mean-spirited] [campaign on] [both sides]
[Elected to] [Congress in] [1978 the] [48-year-old Mr.] [Courter is] [part of] [a generation] [of young] [conservatives who] [were once] [very much] [in the] [lead of] [the rightward] [shift under] [Mr. Reagan]
[Like many] [of his] [colleagues he] [did n't] [serve in] [Vietnam in] [the 1960s] [embraced a] [hawkish defense] [and foreign] [policy even] [voting against] [a 1984] [resolution critical] [of the] [U.S. mining] [of Nicaraguan] [harbors]
[Jack Kemp] [the writers] [Irving Kristol] [and George] [Gilder were] [influences Mr.] [Courter 's] [own conservative] [credentials proved] [useful to] [the current] [New Jersey] [GOP governor] [Thomas Kean] [in the] [1981 Republican] [primary here]
[The same] [partnership is] [now crucial] [to Mr.] [Courter 's] [fortunes the] [abortion issue] [is only] [a reminder] [of the] [gap between] [his record] [that of] [the more] [moderate ,] [pro-choice Gov.] [Kean]
[While the] [Warren County] [congressman pursued] [an anti-government] [, anti-tax] [agenda in] [Washington Gov.] [Kean was] [approving increased] [income and] [sales taxes] [at home] [overseeing a] [near doubling] [in the] [size of] [New Jersey] ['s budget] [in his] [eight years] [in office]
[Kean forces] [play down] [any differences] [with Mr.] [Courter this] [history makes] [it harder] [for the] [conservative to] [run against] [government]
[Mr. Courter] ['s free-market] [plan to] [bring down] [auto insurance] [rates met] [criticism from] [Gov. Kean] ['s own] [insurance commissioner]
[Mr. Courter] [is further] [hobbled by] [a record] [of votes] [opposed to] [government regulation] [on behalf] [of consumers]
[Fluent in] [Spanish from] [his days] [in the] [Peace Corps] [Mr. Courter] [actively courts] [minority voters] [seems oddly] [over his] [head]
[He is] [warm and] [polished before] [a Puerto] [Rican Congress] [in Asbury] [Park]
[minutes after] [promising to] [appoint Hispanics] [to high] [posts in] [state government] [he is] [unable to] [say whether] [he has] [ever employed] [any in] [his congressional] [office]
[I do] [n't think] [we do] [now he] [says]
[I think] [we did]
[Asked the] [same question] [after his] [appearance Democrat] [Florio identifies] [a staff] [member by] [name explains] [her whereabouts] [today]
[When he] [is presented] [with a] [poster celebrating] [the organization] ['s 20th] [anniversary he] [recognizes a] [photograph of] [one of] [the founders] [recalls time] [spent together] [in Camden]
[Details and] [Camden are] [essential Florio]
[Elected to] [Congress as] [a ``] [Watergate baby] [in 1974] [he ran] [for governor] [three years] [later]
[In the] [opinion of] [many he] [has n't] [stopped running] [since even] [though he] [declined a] [rematch with] [Gov. Kean] [in 1985]
[His base] [in South] [Jersey and] [on the] [House Energy] [and Commerce] [Committee helped] [him sustain] [a network] [of political-action] [committees to] [preserve his] [edge]
[With limited] [budgets for] [television in] [a high-priced] [market Mr.] [Florio 's] [higher recognition] [than his] [rival is] [a major] [advantage]
[More than] [ever his] [pro-consumer and] [pro-environment record] [is in] [sync with] [the state]
[Auto insurance] [rates are] [soaring]
[A toxic-waste-dump] [fire destroyed] [part of] [an interstate] [highway this] [summer]
[In Monmouth] [an important] [swing area] [Republican freeholders] [now run] [on a] [slogan promising] [to keep] [the county] [clean and] [green]
[Mr. Florio] [savors this] [vindication at] [age 52] [the congressman] [is also] [a product] [of his] [times and] [losses]
[He speaks] [for the] [death penalty] [as if] [reading from] [Exodus 21] [to increase] [state revenue] [he focuses] [on taxes] [but on] [audits to] [cut waste]
[Hard-hitting consultants] [match ads] [with Mr.] [Courter 's] [team Mr.] [Florio retools] [himself as] [the lean] [, mean] [Democratic fighting] [machine of] [the 1990s]
[Appealing to] [a young] [audience he] [scraps an] [old reference] [to Ozzie] [and Harriet] [instead quotes] [the Grateful] [Dead]
[The lyric] [chosen long] [strange night] [may be] [an apt] [footnote to] [television spots] [by both] [candidates intended] [to portray] [each other] [as a] [liar]
[The Democratic] [lawmaker fits] [a pattern] [of younger] [reformers arising] [out of] [old machines] [his ties] [to Camden] [remain a] [sore point] [because of] [the county] ['s past] [corruption]
[His campaign] [hierarchy is] [chosen from] [elsewhere in] [the state] [faced with] [criticism of] [a sweetheart] [bank investment] [he has] [so far] [blunted the] [issue by] [donating the] [bulk of] [his profits] [to his] [alma mater] [Trenton State] [College]
[Mr. Florio] ['s forcefulness] [on the] [abortion issue] [after the] [Webster ruling] [divides some] [of his] [old constituency]
[Pasquale Pignatelli] [an unlikely] [but enthusiastic] [pipe major] [in an] [Essex County] [Irish bagpipe] [band speaks] [sadly of] [Mr. Florio]
[I am] [a devout] [Catholic says] [Mr. Pignatelli] [a 40-year-old] [health officer]
[I ca] [n't support] [him because] [of abortion]
[Bill Wames] [Sr. 72] [is Catholic] [too unfazed] [by Mr.] [Florio 's] [stand on] [abortion]
[A security] [guard at] [a cargo] [terminal he] [wears of] [Italy jacket] [and cap] [celebrating The] [US 1] [Band]
[I still] [think the] [woman has] [the right] [to do] [with her] [body as] [she pleases] [he says]
[If you] [want more] [opinions ask] [my wife]
[She has] [lots of] [opinions]
[Consumer prices] [rose a] [surprisingly moderate] [0.2 %] [in September] [pushed up] [mostly by] [a jump] [in clothing] [costs the] [Labor Department] [reported]
[Energy costs] [which drove] [wholesale prices] [up sharply] [during the] [month continued] [to decline] [at the] [retail level] [pulling down] [transportation helping] [to ease] [housing costs]
[The report] [was the] [brightest news] [the financial] [markets had] [seen since] [the stock] [market plunged] [more than] [190 points] [last Friday]
[The Dow] [Jones Industrial] [Average rallied] [on the] [news closing] [39.55 points] [higher at] [2683.20]
[Bond prices] [also jumped] [as traders] [appeared to] [read the] [data as] [a sign] [that interest] [rates may] [fall]
[many economists] [were nearly] [as jubilant]
[The climb] [in wholesale] [energy prices] [is certain] [to push] [up retail] [energy prices] [in the] [next few] [months they] [warned]
[They also] [said the] [dollar is] [leveling off] [after a] [rise this] [summer that] [helped to] [reduce the] [prices of] [imported goods]
[I think] [inflation is] [going to] [pick up] [through the] [fall said] [Joel Popkin] [a specialist] [on inflation] [who runs] [an economic] [consulting firm] [here]
[It has] [been in] [what I] [would describe] [as a] [lull for] [the past] [several months]
[We 've] [had whopping] [declines in] [consumer energy] [prices in] [each of] [the past] [three months] [at the] [wholesale level] [those are] [fully behind] [us now] [said Jay] [Woodworth chief] [domestic economist] [at Bankers] [Trust Co.] [in New] [York]
[Because wholesale] [energy prices] [shot up] [by a] [steep 6.5] [% last] [month many] [analysts expected] [energy prices] [to rise] [at the] [consumer level] [too]
[As a] [result many] [economists were] [expecting the] [consumer price] [index to] [increase significantly] [more than] [it did]
[retail energy] [prices declined] [0.9 %] [in September]
[Though analysts] [say competition] [will probably] [hold down] [increases in] [retail energy] [prices many] [expect some] [of the] [wholesale rise] [to be] [passed along] [to the] [consumer before] [the end] [of the] [year]
[Still some] [analysts insisted] [that the] [worst of] [the inflation] [is behind]
[It increasingly] [appears that] [1987-88 was] [a temporary] [inflation blip] [and not] [the beginning] [of a] [cyclical inflation] [problem argued] [Edward Yardeni] [chief economist] [at Prudential-Bache] [Securities Inc.] [in New] [York]
[In both] [1987 and] [1988 consumer] [prices rose] [4.4 %]
[A run-up] [in world] [oil prices] [last winter] [sent consumer] [prices soaring] [at a] [6.7 %] [annual rate] [in the] [first five] [months of] [this year] [the subsequent] [decline in] [energy prices] [has pulled] [the annual] [rate back] [down to] [4.4 %]
[Mr. Yardeni] [predicted that] [world business] [competition will] [continue to] [restrain prices]
[The bottom] [line is] [it seems] [to me] [that the] [economic environment] [has become] [very ,] [very competitve] [for a] [lot of] [businesses he] [said]
[Back in] [1987-88 business] [was operating] [at fairly] [tight capacity] [businesses felt] [they could] [raise prices]
[Now he] [said a] [slowdown in] [economic activity] [has slackened] [demand]
[The mild] [inflation figures] [renewed investors] [' hopes] [that the] [Federal Reserve] [will ease] [its interest-rate] [stance]
[The steep] [climb in] [producer prices] [reported last] [Friday fostered] [pessimism about] [lower interest] [rates contributed] [to the] [stock market] ['s 6.9] [% plunge] [that day]
[In the] [past several] [days however] [the U.S.] ['s central] [bank has] [allowed a] [key interest] [rate to] [fall slightly] [to try] [to stabilize] [the markets]
[Analysts say] [Fed policy] [makers have] [been wary] [of relaxing] [credit too] [much because] [they were] [still uncertain] [about the] [level of] [inflation in] [the economy]
[Excluding the] [volatile categories] [of energy] [and food] [leaving what] [some economists] [call the] [core inflation] [rate consumer] [prices still] [rose only] [0.2 %] [in September]
[Transportation costs] [actually fell] [0.5 %] [housing costs] [gained only] [0.1 %]
[Apparel prices] [rocketed up] [1.7 %] [that was] [after three] [months of] [declines]
[Medical costs] [continued their] [steep ascent] [rising 0.8] [% after] [four consecutive] [months of] [0.7 %] [increases]
[Car prices] [another area] [that contributed] [to the] [steep rise] [in the] [wholesale index] [last month] [still showed] [declines at] [the consumer] [level]
[They dropped] [0.4 %] [as dealers] [continued to] [offer rebates] [to attract] [customers]
[Food prices] [rose 0.2] [% for] [the second] [month in] [a row] [far slower] [than the] [monthly rises] [earlier in] [the year]
[Separately the] [Labor Department] [reported that] [average weekly] [earnings rose] [0.3 %] [in September] [after adjusting] [for inflation] [following a] [0.7 %] [decline in] [August]
[All the] [numbers are] [adjusted for] [seasonal fluctuations]
[Here are] [the seasonally] [adjusted changes] [in the] [components of] [the Labor] [Department 's] [consumer price] [index for] [September]
[After watching] [interest in] [the sport] [plummet for] [years the] [ski industry] [is trying] [to give] [itself a] [lift]
[Across the] [country resorts] [are using] [everything from] [fireworks to] [classical-music concerts] [to attract] [new customers]
[Some have] [built health] [spas business] [centers shopping] [villages visitors] [have more] [to do] [than ski]
[this week] [the industry] ['s efforts] [will go] [national for] [the first] [time when] [it unveils] [a $] [7 million] [advertising campaign]
[Such efforts] [unheard of] [only a] [few years] [ago are] [the latest] [attempts to] [revive the] [sagging $] [1.76 billion] [U.S. ski] [industry]
[Since the] [start of] [the decade] [lift-ticket sales] [have grown] [only 3] [% a] [year on] [average compared] [with 16] [% annual] [growth rates] [in the] ['60s and] ['70s]
[Last season] [lift-ticket sales] [fell for] [the first] [time in] [seven years]

[Ski promotions] [have traditionally] [avoided the] [touchy issue] [of safety]

[Now the] [ambivalent middle] [a moral] [majority of] [sorts is] [reasserting itself]
[Within a] [few years] [the outcome] [in most] [states is] [likely to] [be abortion] [will be] [more restricted] [, but] [not completely] [banned]

[A new] [product NewsEdge] [carries five] [business news] [wires simultaneously] [into a] [user 's] [computer beeps] [and flashes] [whenever an] [article appears] [that is] [of interest] [to the] [user]
[The product] [developed by] [Desktop Data] [Corp. a] [new company] [based in] [Waltham Mass.] [scans the] [wires looking] [for articles] [that contain] [key words] [specified by] [the user]
[One early] [user David] [Semmel a] [Chicago venture] [capitalist investor] [in Desktop] [Data says] [he uses] [it to] [track takeover] [developments]
[He says] [he told] [NewsEdge to] [look for] [stories containing] [such words] [as takeover] [, acquisition] [, acquire] [, LBO] [, tender] [, merger] [, junk] [and halted]
[I 'm] [pretty confident] [I 'm] [catching everything] [he says]

[Jeffrey Tarter] [editor of] [SoftLetter a] [Watertown ,] [Mass. ,] [industry newsletter] [says I] ['ve seen] [a lot] [of people] [fooling around] [on the] [fringes of] [filtering information]
[This is] [the first] [time I] ['ve seen] [something I] [could imagine] [a lot] [of people] [using]
[NewsEdge uses] [an FM] [radio band] [to carry] [news wires] [provided by] [Reuters McGraw-Hill] [Dow Jones] [& Co.] [as well] [as PR] [Newswire which] [carries corporate] [press releases]
[An FM] [receiver attached] [to a] [user 's] [personal computer] [receives the] [information]
[Some organizations] [have devised] [their own] [systems to] [sort through] [news wire] [items as] [they come] [in]
[George Goodwin] [an account] [manager at] [Royal Bank] [of Canada] [adapted a] [Lotus Development] [Corp. program] [called Agenda] [to sort] [through international] [news wires]
[It automatically] [selects stories] [from particular] [countries for] [reading by] [the international] [bankers responsible] [for lending] [in those] [areas]
[For those] [who do] [n't need] [their personalized] [information moment] [by moment] [some services] [are offering] [overnight newsletters]
[Individual Inc.] [a new] [company in] [Brookline Mass.] [uses filtering] [technology developed] [by Cornell] [University computer] [scientist Gerard] [Salton to] [automatically produce] [customized newsletters] [it sends] [electronically to] [subscribers by] [8 a.m.] [the next] [day]
[We are] [operating an] [information refinery] [that takes] [a broad] [stream of] [raw data] [turns it] [into actionable] [knowledge says] [Yosi Amram] [founder and] [president]
[The daily] [newsletter which] [is widely] [available yet] [will have] [a base] [cost of] [$ 2,000] [a year] [provides full] [text of] [relevant articles] [under license] [agreements with] [Reuters McGraw] [Hill United] [Press International] [two press] [release news] [wires Japan] ['s Kyodo] [news service]
[One early] [user is] [NEC Corp.] ['s U.S.] [printer marketing] [arm]
[They want] [the full] [press releases] [on printer] [announcements by] [their competition] [Mr. Amram] [says]
[It also] [tracks personnel] [and financial] [announcements by] [NEC 's] [distributors and] [customers]
[Individual Inc.] ['s technology] [goes beyond] [word searches] [by using] [a computerized] [thesaurus]
[If a] [customer asks] [for stories] [about IBM] [the computer] [will also] [supply stories] [that mention] [I.B.M. International] [Business Machines] [Big Blue] [Mr. Amram] [says]
[Moreover Individual] [Inc. 's] [computers can] [weigh the] [value of] [an article] [based on] [how closely] [the story] [matches the] [subscriber 's] [interest area]
[It compares] [the position] [of key] [words in] [the story] [words in] [the headline] [or first] [paragraph get] [a higher] [value]
[it calculates] [how often] [the words] [appear in] [the story] [compared with] [how often] [they appear] [in the] [entire data] [base]

[The computers] [find all] [the key] [words they] [can the] [editors confirm] [every one]
[Computer picking] [is perfect] [says Harvey] [Golomb president] [and founder] [of Pinpoint]
[The humans] [also write] [abstracts of] [articles from] [some 200] [computer industry] [publications]
[all the] [articles are] [coded put] [in a] [data base] [Pinpoint 's] [computers pick] [the most] [relevant for] [each subscriber] [lay them] [out in] [a three-to-five-page] [newsletter format] [each newsletter] [is sent] [directly from] [the computer] [to the] [subscriber 's] [fax machine]
[Mr. Golomb] [says each] [of his] [computers can] [produce and] [send about] [75 unique] [newsletters a] [night]
[Many computer] [network users] [who never] [see news] [wires would] [like to] [sort through] [their electronic] [mail automatically]
[So-called E-mail] [is the] [collection of] [inter-office memos] [gossip technical] [data schedules] [directives distributed] [over local] [and national] [computer networks]
[All these] [interconnected computers] [make it] [difficult to] [sort out] [what 's] [junk what] ['s important] [says Chuck] [Digate a] [former Lotus] [Development executive] [who has] [started a] [new company] [to cope] [with the] [problem]
[Mr. Digate] [says his] [firm Beyond] [Inc. has] [licensed technology] [known as] [Information Lens] [from Massachusetts] [Institute of] [Technology plans] [to develop] [it for] [commercial use]
[The MIT] [project devised] [ways for] [E-mail to] [be automatically] [categorized as] [top priority] [if it] [comes from] [certain designated] [senders requires] [action in] [the next] [couple of] [days]
[Mr. Digate] [says Beyond] [will refine] [the product] [so the] [message will] [be smart] [enough to] [know to] [come back] [bother you] [again next] [week]
[if a] [user is] [busy he] [can set] [it for] [crisis mode] [Do n't] [bother me] [with reports] [until Monday]
[A program] [called Notes] [which is] [under development] [by Lotus] [also is] [designed to] [sort E-mail] [sent within] [work groups]
[One thing] [that makes] [E-mail difficult] [to sift] [through is] [that each] [item looks] [the same]
[Notes which] [is designed] [for advanced] [computers that] [display graphics] [allows mail] [senders to] [put different] [logos on] [their mail]
[A daily] [news briefing] [from the] [company librarian] [for example] [would have] [a distinctive] [format on] [the screen] [just as] [a paper] [version would] [have]
[With E-mail] [you do] [n't have] [the visual] [clues of] [paper says] [Mr. Tarter] [the editor] [of SoftLetter]
[With Notes] [they 're] [visually distinct]

[Pending an] [appeal by] [the New] [Zealand team] [led by] [Michael Fay] [the finals] [for the] [next Cup] [challenge are] [scheduled to] [be held] [in mid-1992] [in San] [Diego]
[because of] [the uncertainty] [of the] [outcome of] [the suit] [Mr. Conner] ['s team] [has done] [little to] [begin gearing] [up to] [defend its] [title]
[If you] [do n't] [know what] [the rules] [of the] [game are] [it 's] [hard to] [start your] [fund-raising or] [design said] [Dana Smith] [an official] [with Team] [Dennis Conner]
[The Conner] [team wo] [n't be] [able to] [negotiate with] [corporate sponsors] [until the] [suit is] [resolved the] [race site] [is determined] [Mr. Smith] [said the] [syndicate 's] [budget could] [easily reach] [$ 30] [million]
[spokesmen for] [both Mr.] [Isler Mr.] [Conner say] [the formation] [of the] [new syndicate] [has to] [do with] [Mr. Isler] ['s desire] [to skipper] [his own] [team begin] [planning now] [rather than] [any falling] [between the] [two sportsmen]
[Mr. Smith] [a spokesman] [for the] [America 's] [Cup Organizing] [Committee insist] [that the] [added competition] [for the] [defender 's] [spot will] [only improve] [the race]
[Missouri farmer] [Blake Hurst] [writing in] [the fall] [issue of] [the Heritage] [Foundation 's] [Policy Review] [about the] [proposed location] [of a] [hazardous-waste incinerator] [in his] [county]
[Of course] [I rather] [have a] [computer software] [firm in] [my backyard] [than a] [hazardous waste] [incinerator]
[I rather] [live next] [door to] [an incinerator] [than to] [some of] [the hog] [farms I] ['ve seen] [-LRB- and] [smelt in] [these parts]
[An incinerator] [is also] [probably better] [than having] [nobody next] [door on] [our farm] [there are] [four unoccupied] [houses]
[On my] [four-mile drive] [to farm] [headquarters each] [morning I] [drive by] [another four] [empty houses]
[A community] [of abandoned] [farmsteads failing] [businesses crumbling] [roads and] [bridges is] [hardly a] [desirable one]
[The loss] [of 40] [jobs by] [a depressed] [county in] [rural Missouri] [is hardly] [of national] [importance except] [for this] [If the] [most environmentally] [safe way] [of dealing] [with a] [national problem] [can not] [be built] [in Atchinson] [County what] [hope have] [we for] [dealing with] [the wastes] [our economy] [produces]
[After all] [farmers here] [work with] [`` hazardous] ['' chemicals] [every day] [many of] [them the] [same chemicals] [that would] [have been] [destroyed in] [the incinerator]
[We know] [they are] [dangerous if] [handled with] [care their] [benefits far] [outweigh any] [risk to] [the environment]
[Just because] [Stamford ,] [Conn. ,] [High School] [did nothing] [when its] [valuable 1930s] [mural was] [thrown in] [the trash] [does n't] [mean the] [city no] [longer owns] [the work] [of art] [a federal] [judge ruled]
[The mural] [now valued] [at $] [1.3 million] [according to] [appraisers was] [tossed in] [a trash] [heap in] [1971 by] [workers who] [were renovating] [the building]
[The 100-foot-long] [mural painted] [by James] [Daugherty in] [1934 was] [commissioned by] [the federal] [Works Project] [Administration]
[After the] [discarded mural] [was found] [outside the] [school by] [a concerned] [Stamford graduate] [it eventually] [was turned] [over to] [Hiram Hoelzer] [a professional] [art restorer]
[Throughout the] [1970s Stamford] [school and] [city officials] [made no] [effort to] [locate the] [mural]
[Apparently the] [officials did] [n't even] [know the] [mural was] [missing until] [1980 when] [a researcher] [found that] [the painting] [was in] [Mr. Hoelzer] ['s studio] [questioned school] [officials about] [it]
[In 1986] [Stamford officials] [thanked Mr.] [Hoelzer for] [taking care] [of the] [mural demanded] [he return] [it as] [soon as] [possible]
[Mr. Hoelzer] [however sued] [Stamford claiming] [that the] [city had] [abandoned the] [artwork that] [it had] [waited too] [long to] [reclaim it]
[Judge Louis] [L. Stanton] [of federal] [court in] [Manhattan ruled] [that the] [city could] [n't be] [faulted for] [waiting too] [long because] [it did] [n't realize] [until 1986] [its ownership] [of the] [painting was] [in dispute]
[The judge] [also ruled] [that the] [painting was] [n't abandoned] [because officials] [did n't] [intend for] [it to] [be thrown] [away were] [unaware that] [the workmen] [had discarded] [it]
[Mr. Hoelzer] [did n't] [return phone] [calls seeking] [comment on] [the judge] ['s decision]
[The judge] [ordered that] [a hearing] [be held] [Nov. 17] [to determine] [how much] [the city] [should pay] [Mr. Hoelzer] [for his] [services]
[Mary E.] [Sommer corporate] [counsel for] [Stamford said] [the city] [has discussed] [several possible] [plans for] [displaying the] [mural which] [portrays various] [scenes from] [the Great] [Depression]
[She said] [the mural] [preserves an] [era in] [Stamford and] [in our] [country when] [this type] [of work] [was being] [done]
[The prices] [of corn] [futures contracts] [jumped amid] [rumors that] [the Soviet] [Union is] [keeping up] [its dizzying] [October buying] [binge of] [U.S. corn]
[Those rumors] [were confirmed] [after the] [end of] [trading yesterday] [when the] [U.S. Agriculture] [Department announced] [that the] [Soviets had] [bought 1.2] [million metric] [tons of] [U.S. corn] [bringing their] [U.S. corn] [purchases confirmed] [so far] [this month] [to about] [five million] [metric tons]
[In trading] [at the] [Chicago Board] [of Trade] [the corn] [contract for] [December delivery] [jumped 5.75] [cents a] [bushel to] [settle at] [$ 2.44] [a bushel]
[The Soviet] [purchases are] [close to] [exceeding what] [some analysts] [had expected] [the Soviet] [Union to] [buy this] [fall the] [season in] [which it] [usually buys] [much of] [the corn] [it imports] [from the] [U.S.]
[That pace] [is causing] [some analysts] [to speculate] [that the] [Soviet Union] [might soon] [purchase as] [much as] [another two] [million metric] [tons]
[One sign] [that more] [Soviet purchases] [are possible] [is U.S.] [grain companies] [yesterday bought] [an unusually] [large amount] [of corn] [futures contracts]
[That sometimes] [signals that] [they are] [laying plans] [to export] [corn]
[By some] [estimates several] [grain companies] [combined bought] [contracts for] [the possession] [of roughly] [one million] [metric tons] [of corn]
[By buying] [futures contracts] [these companies] [attempt to] [protect themselves] [from swings] [in the] [price of] [the corn] [that they] [are obligated] [to deliver]
[Rumors of] [Soviet interest] [also pushed] [up the] [prices of] [soybean futures] [contracts]
[Among other] [things the] [Agriculture Department] [is widely] [thought to] [be mulling] [whether to] [subsidize the] [sale of] [soybean oil] [to the] [Soviet Union]
[On top] [of all] [this corn] [and soybean] [prices rose] [on reports] [that the] [Midwest harvest] [was disrupted] [by a] [freakishly early] [snow storm] [that dumped] [several inches] [in parts] [of Indiana] [and Ohio]
[The harvest] [delays however] [are expected] [to be] [temporary]
[Balmy temperatures] [are forecast] [for next] [week said] [Robert Lekberg] [an analyst] [at Farmers] [Grain &] [Livestock Corp.] [Chicago]
[Many farmers] [used the] [jump in] [prices to] [sell their] [recently harvested] [crop to] [grain elevator] [companies]
[The heavy] [selling by] [farmers helped] [to damp] [the price] [rally]
[Wheat futures] [prices rose] [slightly]
[In other] [commodity markets] [yesterday]
[PRECIOUS METALS]
[Futures prices] [declined]
[A number] [of developments] [were negatively] [interpreted by] [traders]
[December delivery] [gold fell] [$ 1.80] [an ounce] [to $] [370.60]
[December silver] [eased 2.7] [cents an] [ounce to] [$ 5.133]
[January platinum] [was down] [$ 3.60] [an ounce] [at $] [491.10]
[One price-depressing] [development was] [the lower-than-expected] [increase of] [only 0.2] [% in] [the consumer] [price index] [for September] [an analyst] [said]
[He noted] [that the] [`` core] [inflation rate] [which excludes] [food and] [energy was] [also low] [at 0.2] [%]
[Other news] [that weighed] [on the] [market Initial] [unemployment claims] [rose by] [62,000 last] [week American] [Telephone &] [Telegraph Co.] [will reduce] [its managerial] [staff by] [15,000 through] [attrition the] [oil market] [turned weaker] [there was] [any investor] [demand for] [bullion the] [dollar strengthened] [during the] [day putting] [pressure on] [gold]
[Also the] [analyst said] [economic circumstances] [are such] [that both] [South Africa] [the Soviet] [Union the] [principal gold] [and platinum] [producers are] [being forced] [to continue] [selling the] [metals]
[Both are] [in great] [need of] [foreign exchange] [South Africa] [is also] [under pressure] [to meet] [foreign loan] [commitments he] [said]
[Putting it] [all together] [we have] [a negative] [scenario that] [does n't] [look like] [it will] [improve overnight] [he said]
[Futures prices] [recovered in] [quiet trading]
[The December] [contract rose] [1.50 cents] [a pound] [to $] [1.2795]
[That contract] [fell a] [total of] [5.75 cents] [during the] [first three] [days of] [this week] [mostly in] [reaction to] [last Friday] ['s stock] [market plunge] [which prompted] [concern that] [it might] [signal a] [similar sharp] [slowing of] [the U.S.] [economy thus] [reduced demand] [for copper] [a leading] [industrial metal]
[In recent] [days however] [there has] [been increased] [purchasing of] [copper in] [London an] [analyst said]
[Some of] [this buying] [was by] [Japan which] [has had] [its supplies] [sharply reduced] [by long] [production stoppages] [at the] [Bougainville mine] [in Papua] [New Guinea] [Highland Valley] [mine in] [British Columbia] [the Cananea] [mine in] [Mexico which] [are major] [shippers to] [Japan]
[The increasing] [likelihood that] [Cananea Highland] [Valley will] [soon return] [to production] [may have] [cut some] [of that] [purchasing even] [if any] [of these] [mines begin] [operating soon] [their output] [wo n't] [be significant] [until at] [least the] [end of] [the year] [analysts note]
[So one] [analyst said] [even though] [the long-term] [production problems] [may be] [easing there] [will still] [be a] [significant need] [for copper] [over the] [next three] [months when] [inventories will] [remain relatively] [low]
[Crude oil] [prices ended] [mixed]
[West Texas] [Intermediate for] [November delivery] [fell 14] [cents a] [barrel to] [$ 20.42]
[so-called outer] [month contracts] [finished higher]
[For instance] [December contracts] [for WTI] [rose 17] [cents to] [$ 20.42]
[Most energy] [futures opened] [lower following] [Wednesday 's] [market downturn]
[a flurry] [of late] [trading yesterday] [beefed up] [prices]
[Heating oil] [and gasoline] [futures ended] [higher as] [well]
[Melvin Belli] ['s San] [Francisco law] [offices may] [have been] [the epicenter] [of legal] [activity after] [Tuesday 's] [earthquake]
[In the] [first 25] [minutes after] [his office] ['s telephone] [service was] [restored yesterday] [morning 17] [potential clients] [had called] [seeking the] [services of] [the self-proclaimed] [King of] [Torts]
[Mr. Belli] [like many] [other personal-injury] [lawyers suspects] [that the] [earthquake which] [measured 6.9] [on the] [Richter scale] [will generate] [enough lawsuits] [to keep] [this city] ['s personal-injury] [and construction] [lawyers busy] [for quite] [some time]
[Suits are] [likely to] [be filed] [against engineering] [firms contractors] [developers as] [well as] [against local-government] [agencies]
[lawyers looking] [to cash] [in on] [the quake] [may have] [a tough] [time once] [their cases] [reach a] [judge]
[Experts on] [California tort] [law say] [protections afforded] [government agencies] [in such] [cases are] [pretty ironclad]
[Even claims] [against individuals] [and companies] [face significant] [roadblocks]
[The major] [legal barrier] [is the] [principle that] [no one] [can be] [held liable] [for an] [`` act] [of God]
[For now] [says Laurence] [Drivon president-elect] [of the] [6,000-member California] [Trial Lawyers] [Association the] [last thing] [we really] [need to] [worry about] [is whether] [anybody is] [going to] [get sued] [whether they] [have liability]
[We still] [have people] [wandering around] [in a] [daze in] [San Francisco] [worrying about] [whether it] ['s going] [to rain] [tonight]
[that wo] [n't stop] [plaintiffs '] [lawyers from] [seeking a] [little room] [for maneuvering]
[In San] [Francisco they] [argue an] [earthquake was] [a near] [certainty]
[Therefore engineering] [firms ,] [construction contractors] [and developers] [can be] [sued for] [keeping structures] [up to] [standard government] [agencies can] [be held] [accountable for] [failing to] [properly protect] [citizens from] [such a] [foreseeable disaster] [if negligence] [can be] [proven]
[My prediction] [is there] [will be] [mass litigation] [over errors] [and omissions] [in engineering] [and contracting] [says Stanley] [Chesley a] [well-known Cincinnati] [plaintiffs lawyer]
[From what] [he saw] [on television] [Mr. Chesley] [points out] [that Interstate] [880 which] [collapsed killed] [more than] [200 commuters] [suffered serious] [damage while] [surrounding buildings] [appeared to] [sustain no] [damage whatsoever]
[He adds] [that they] [were aware] [of the] [propensity for] [earthquakes the] [San Andreas] [Fault]
[The flamboyant] [and publicity-conscious] [Mr. Belli] [says he] [already has] [investigators looking] [into who] [could be] [held liable] [for the] [damage on] [the Bay] [Bridge the] [interstate approaching] [it]
[We wo] [n't know] [until the] [smoke clears] [yes we] ['re looking] [into it] [he says]
[Mr. Belli] [says he] [wants to] [know whether] [state or] [federal engineers] [private companies] [could have] [prevented the] [damage]
[Mr. Belli] [who was] [at Candlestick] [Park for] [the World] [Series Tuesday] [night says] [he has] [hired civil] [engineers to] [check out] [his own] [mildly damaged] [building to] [investigate the] [bridge collapse]
[Defense lawyers] [perhaps understandably] [say that] [plaintiffs '] [lawyers taking] [such an] [approach will] [have little] [success in] [pursuing their] [claims though] [they add] [that the] [facts of] [each case] [must be] [looked at] [individually]
[Under the] [statute agencies] [are provided] [defenses that] [normally are] [available in] [the private] [sector Mr.] [Ruvolo says]
[The legislature] [does not] [want to] [inhibit the] [unique government] [activities by] [exposing public] [entities to] [liability]
[Built into] [the statute] [are so-called] [design immunities] [which are] [likely to] [protect government] [agencies according] [to Mr.] [Ruvolo Richard] [Covert a] [lawyer with] [the California] [Department of] [Transportation which] [oversees the] [damaged Bay] [Bridge]
[The state] [is protected] [when plans] [and designs] [for public] [structures were] [approved ahead] [of time] [when structures] [met previously] [approved standards] [says Mr.] [Covert]
[He believes] [those defenses] [might well] [apply to] [the Bay] [Bridge collapse]
[Nevertheless he] [adds I] [would n't] [get totally] [shocked if] [we get] [lawsuits out] [of the] [Bay Bridge]
[If there] ['s going] [to be] [a race] [to the] [courthouse it] [has n't] [started yet]
[Mr. Covert] [had to] [search through] [law books] [scattered on] [the floor] [of his] [office yesterday] [Mr. Belli] ['s courtyard] [was strewn] [with bricks]
